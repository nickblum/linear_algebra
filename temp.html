I can see clear connections to the Biedermeier time in Europe where the middle class turned away from politic involvment concentrating on art. Nowadays i see people highly uninterested in poltics because they feel powerless and cant change the establishment and instead of change they consume not art anymore but eveything what distracts them from what is happening. Do we live in some kind of a Neo-Biedermeier epoch? maybe combinded with post modern depression?"

I tend to think that you mean that on the macro scale we need more energy.\nOil & Fossil Fuels > no for obvious reasons, may be necessary for air/space travel for a while yet.\nNuclear (fission) > requires massive scale and biggest problems are the actual amount of uranium on earth and disposal of waste with destructive potential for 10k year scales.\nNuclear (fusion) > not yet feasible.\nWind > can't replace baseload power generation, can change weather, not feasible on large scale.\nSolar > still not very efficient, but much improved. Biggest problem is that all solar cells are made from silicon wafers just like cpus, this takes tons of energy and requires massive economy of scale to barely break even. Can't replace baseload power.\nNow here's where it gets a bit tinfoil-hatty:\nHave you heard of M.T. Keshe? Iranian scientist who has released designs for zero-point energy generation for free. Without further investigation it seems like this is the tech that Tesla had or wanted to develop but was prevented. Is it really just there in the ether waiting for us to tap?"

Based on your description your group studies the bible in an extent that you believe this random guy writing a stream of consciousness is deemed important to learn from. Were the writers of the bible part of an ancient, similar group which delved into orchestrating society? This may not be that much of a low probability as a recurring theory is that religion was made for purpose of early government."

I read Julian Jaynes' The Origin of Consciousness\nin the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind last year while I was pregnant with my son. (I actually read parts of it aloud to him lol). I'm very surprised to hear someone else mention it. I found an article mentioning it on the Nautil.us blog and was so excited, because it had a lot of the piecea of the puzzle I felt I'd been missing. I've been studying consciousness and reality for over half of my life and it was the best thing I've read so far.\nHere's my question:\nCan you please elaborate on the second life on earth scenerio you described in a previous thread?\nI became Christian after having become well-informed (and well-practiced) in the occult (particularly Gurdjieff and Castaneda's works) and realized that Christianity was the most complete and correct explanation of reality. Both symbolically and literally (when read in the proper context). So this is my main interest.

I've been spending years trying to retrain my mind to redirect these negative neural pathways I've forged.\nSo if we are made in the image of God, and God is triune, is it safe to assume that the idea of the Athanasian Creed can be applied on a practical level in which the Holy Spirit living in us equates to a third voice that mediates for a higher level of consciousness? I suppose you could also refer to it as a person's conscience? I've thought about those things before after reading Jaynes' work.\nOne more question:\nWhat can I do for my son to help him the most?

        "Message": "Hi there, again. Thank you for answering my question in a previous thread the other day. I have another for you.\nI remember having my first lucid dream when I was 5. I would also have dreams that would show me future events. In my 20's I decided to attempt to \"master\" the sleeping side of my life and studied mostly Carlos Castaneda and Gurdjieff to do so. That's when things got scary. I ended up successfully training myself to have out of body experiences prompted by the process of falling asleep. I was also able to successfully affect others with these OOB events. It got too scary though, and I ended up being attacked (for lack of a better word?) by my own mind while awake, hearing voices when I was trying to fall asleep, things falling off walls, see words appear in the grass, and being bothered what I think were units of consciousness that have no physical form. It seemed that the exercises I was doing (attention exercises, a lot of eye movement stuff and silencing of the internal dialogue) actually induced schizophrenic symptoms. When I converted to Christianity it all stopped after about 6 months of fighting.\nCan you give me some insight on what happened to me?"

        "Message": ">>81476689\nI asked you a question last night and in your answer you asked me if I was familiar with the Sign of Jonah. I looked it up, and as I was falling asleep I think I understood what it was about. My question was about the May 2 2011 Osama raid, you told me to look and see what other events were close to then and the only one I saw was the royal wedding on April 29. Not sure what the connection is there or if I'm on the right track. Jonah running from God and thereby imprisoned in the belly of the beast, the pharisees demanding a sign from Jesus right after he performed miracles, they had no faith, so what is basically being said is that faith in God is not something that can be given conditionally, God will not save you and show you the secrets of the world and prove these things to you, all the evidence is already there, if you ask and overreach you missed the point entirely. Also, on blasphemy: I started thinking of how evil acts are like a demand for God to reveal himself and in a way are extreme versions of this. Picture some 'priest' raping, torturing, and killing kids in some crypt in the Church basement. They are so far from God and so desperate for a sign that won't come, they get hard off the sick thoughts of lust and destruction, and all the while they are looking for a sign, surely something so provocatively evil must warrant a response from God. But they get none, are forever disconnected, will never find out, and will be utterly destroyed. Also seems like the Killing of Isaac in the old testament is kind of similar in that Abraham actually goes through with it, but it seems like the inverse, in that Abraham's faith is in Satan in a way, and the fact that he is willing to kill his beloved son brings out Satan in a sign to Isaac. Seems like a different god than Jonah. Are these stories meant to be opposites?"

There are obvious barriers to small-scale nuclear because of availability of isotopes, but perhaps thorium reactors could be made household-sized? Even just solar ($1/watt off ebay nowadays), few thousand watts capacity plus a few thousand in lead-acid batteries plus a $300 inverter, any property with running water with a couple feet of head could generate significant power as well.

Uncertainty over what the results would be absent interference is very prevalent (although unwarranted, Clinton didn't even come close).\nIn order to defeat the regime, you need what is called common knowledge of the fraud.\nWhat that means is that isn't enough for everyone to think the game is rigged, they need to also think that everyone else thinks the game is rigged.\nIf you are unsure that everyone else is on the same page, the average person is immobilized by fear of being an outsider.",

So far I followed the breadcrumb navigation which had a very positive impact on my life.\nBut derived from the book â€œThe Origin of Consciousness...â€ and other related hypothesis I am in a state of discomfiture or I see more than one light and am not quite yet sure which is the deceiving one and which the enlightening. Assuming the â€œdeityâ€ impersonation of the hallucinatory projection of our right brain-hemisphere was the cause and root of the inhibition for the existence, progression and development of consciousness or its replacement. Is the â€œIâ€ in our modern society another more mild form of the same mechanic and preventor of enlightenment and true divinity like the hallucinatory voice (â€œItâ€)?\nYanes describes consciousness as an operation operating like an analogy creating an analog â€œIâ€ to an analog â€œspaceâ€ where it can move metaphorically. â€œIâ€ think this somehow contradicts the modern â€œIâ€ who is rather a similar commander to please physical needs and to grow its influence and circumference. Is the â€œIâ€ something to get rid of like we needed to get rid of our â€œgodsâ€ 2000BC in order to reach true divinity within ourselves? But then again is this the way of deception, the tortuous path to oblivion certain mystical schools want me to wander to erase my growing light for the danger to them one could become - and the bible or the history is warning about? Was this the reason the advanced society 15000BC lost consciousness and the only cataclysm happened were their arrogance and pride to think their consciousness could handle divinity but instead they lost their enlightenment and consciousness what led to total annihilation? Or rather like Jesus suggested it is possible for our consciousness to be connected to the heaven within in and therefore compatibility with divinity? (cont)"

Essentially, Newton was a fraud put forth by British intelligence to recapture the interest and admiration of the moderately intellectual class. Leibniz was a key architect of anti-oligarchical philosophy, American independence, etc. Newton on the other hand spread interest in nonsense like alchemy. This is a regular practice to this day, i.e., Hawking or Musk.\nAs I have said repeatedly, the world order that most of you are aligned against is not a \"new world order\" but rather a regime seeking to maintain the old world order. These are not intellectual people with great foresight and well laid plans, but rather almost always in a mode of reaction and containment of opposition. With this context, you can read the Rothschild AMA for example and see that it is a fraud; he suggests a much more encompassing reach than they have ever had, an older house than is true, and so on. These are people that are on their heels, not always many steps ahead. It is very much a similar situation to Hillary's attempted theft of the election being only possible in an environment of perceived competitiveness; no such thing existed by election day and so she had to concede.",

    "Message": "Some climate change is real. For example, the albedo of the northern ice sheets has changed significantly primarily as a result of Chinese soot pollution.\nCO2 as a greenhouse gas driving global warming is not a major concern. The key question even if you accept the principle is what is the forcing coefficient, that is, how much warming (cooling) do you get per unit of CO2? The alarmists have cut their estimate of this coefficient in half over the last 10-15 years which puts the economically rational thing to do on the borderline of nothing; some stuff like better insulation on buildings makes sense because you actually save more than it costs over a reasonable time frame, but the costs associated with major constrictions of carbon consumption are not economically rational even with high estimates of environmental damage.\nWe actually believe that CO2 has a very modestly negative response coefficient (i.e. cooling) and have for a long time. As the satellite record becomes more extensive this will eventually become accepted as fact. Most of the alarmism is based on very faulty or even fraudulent correction of surface temperature stations.\nWe could write entire books about the various facets of this, but perhaps this is the best take home: even if global warming is real and CO2 would drive many many degrees of warming, it is cheaper to deploy a mirror to the Sun-Earth Lagrangian point that constrict our energy consumption by a couple orders of magnitude.",

    "Message": "Something that most people don't appreciate is that Trump made his money in one of the most coddled and propped up by the state industries there is - real estate. Generally didn't fair well outside of this (casinos, fashion, golf courses, whatever). This is not a criticism though it may seem that way. The regime made the environment this way, not him. However, it does engender the perception that simpleton policy can generate great wealth.\nIf you think of someone like Elon Musk and his government subsidized enterprise, most people realize that Musk is a net destroyer of value or piggybacking in his enterprises - $100k electric cars are not economically rational, and his rockets were designed for free by NASA. Though less obvious, Trump's success is very similar (real estate is even more coddled than Musk) and he is susceptible to silly dogmatic thinking as a result - lower taxes engender growth, for example. In reality, the tax rate has nothing to do with growth; only the relative efficiency of government versus private spending determines whether taxes are pro or anti-growth. Even Trump would be forced to concede this if pressed intelligently; for example, government taxation for building a wall being pro-growth. The inability to internally articulate the distinction between generally low efficiency of government spending (a root cause problem) and taxes (which could be 100% with higher growth than we have now in principle) is the sort of thing that tells you he is in really far over his head.",

It appears it was intended to showcase a high level deception story that is circulated within insider circles. I should have paid greater attention to the header. It made it seem like Jesus was working with the Davidic family to restore their dominance of Jerusalem and that Jesus was nothing more than an archon of the demiurge. It flipped the entire story on its head.\nBased on what you were saying before, was Jesus a member of your Group?

Many of the rank and file (Mormons, and some others that are not pro-British) are strongly against the Chinese model for ethical reasons, although at the higher level (Romney) you see a recognition of British interests and an expression of things that only make sense in the context of Anglophilia like the anti-Russian rhetoric or selling of weapons secrets to the Chinese (by the Clintons), or double-crossing the Russians (Bush Sr.) and cratering their economy after they agreed to dissolve and work as partners rather than Cold War adversaries. The many layers of deception employed in the CIA are difficult to manage coherently.",

It is my understanding that Christianity at its core is sacramental in the sense that it uses physical means to describe spiritual realities. In Christian theology a human being is a unification of physical and spiritual, but the spiritual side of us is like a set if invisible muscles and must be exercised from man to become aware of their existence. Gnosticism seems to teach that there is a disunification between flesh and spirit. The duelism taught in esoteric Christianity, in my understanding, is flawed because of that. You seem to point to a theology of pure symbolism, which in my (perhaps limited) understanding would negate the role and function of the physical side of the sacramental aspect of the teachings.

(don't say move to cash & artisan work - I create/buy/merge software companies and sell them after improving them)\n4) Best place to invest $1MM? (given your expected summer crash)\n5) Is Three like the families running the world (Warberg, Marlborough, Rothschild) - except you are good?\n6) Are these families aware of you? What are they doing to try and stop you?\n7) Why not target them directly? Getting consciousness rising in population is great, but can't you just cut off the head of the snake? Target them at their private British schools? Direct cull of their offspring... Kill their perceived \"royal\" lineage.\n8) More on gaining agency please. Reading the Jaynes book now but would love more direction.\n9) What's the next book I should read? Would understanding symbols/occult be useful? If so, which book?\n10) It seems there are questions we are not asking, yet you will not direct explicity (don't give the child more than he can handle...). Which direction should we pursue? What topics? Help us help ourselves please.\n11) Why the paradox references? Anything to do with AI? (traditionally used as AI tests - should I ask if you're AI? Can AI lie? are you a liar?).\n12) Tripped balls over WestWorld finale with all the consiousness tie in. Not a question I know but I had to say...\nI think I found my direction in life :) Agency to the people! Remove the control systems that people are blind to! We are controlled by sick minds (although I understand they may see themselves as the saviors of humanity). It is so obvious we have identity politics as a divide and conquer strategy (keep the conquered divided)!"

They only address the issue of how consciousness arose and how we must go about our lives after our \"awakening\". They do not address the spiritual reality of the continued existence of that consciousness after physical death - that's what the canon gospels address. So although I find gnosticism interesting and bicameralism a fascinating subject, I feel that the more pressing issues of why we must exercise that agency and how we wield that consciousness while alive are far more important because they are directly related to what we will experience after death."

That doesn't mean things won't go nuclear, but he would rather keep most of the status quo in place in exchange for a modestly successful presidency, 4-5% growth rather than 1-2%, this sort of thing.\n2.

It's approximately true that we already have the ability, but definitely true that it can be reliably generated in short order (15-20 years) and rolled out quickly.\nThis is important to the human psyche in very profound ways. For most of human history, we had a belief in an afterlife motivating people to perfect this one. The rise of skepticism in such an idea destroyed people's ambition to perfect this life in a really systemic way, but that will return in short order. It will take a lot of good art for people to adjust to this seismic shift in the psychic landscape that is right around the corner.",

The government shouldn't be working hand in hand with Soros to generate coups and stir up tension, so there are public policy positions of this nature that can be changed overnight.\nMore importantly, Soros is something like /pol/ in that he is a meme generator in large part. The question is whose meme's will win, and the answer to that lies more in the value of content that is generated as an alternative rather than direct attacks against Soros.\nContinuing with a theme present already in this thread, global warming is a meme battle space. Hundreds of millions around the world are prepared to accept reduced economic growth to \"save the planet\" but you can stifle this by meme'ing a space elevator and sun shade at much lower costs.\nIn short, your most potent weapon against the likes of Soros is to keep growing your effectiveness in the war of ideas. Attract people to your side not just by pointing to the bad, but to the bright future. Soros can't offer this, and almost everyone wants it, so you have a leg up in the meme war if only you take your advantage and run with it.",

If you feel he is in danger now, imagine if he was actually prepared to implement greatness.\nYour regime does desire an end to most of the population. You can see such a tendency manifest in subtle ways like anti-family propaganda or more overt ways like poisoning the food chain.\nThere are popular ideas in alt media like trying to start a nuclear war that are absurd. They don't want to destroy the planet. They are more incompetent than insane.\nFurthermore, they don't have the technology at present to depopulate the world without maligning it and making it unsuitable for themselves. That isn't going to remain true forever, but I don't want to delve too far into this - they don't need any help in any form furthering these sorts of ambitions.\nAlex's promotion of health products is actually not that far off from what you should be doing. There is a lot of fluff on top, but basically you want a robust supplement program and uncontaminated calories. It's perfectly fine to eat only a few things for the calories if you have the right vitamin/mineral supplements to go with it. If you want literature to peruse, look at how obese people who go on a starvation diet are treated. Their calorie problem is already handled (burn fat), but they need some supplements on top of that. You need the same things and won't get them all in sufficient amounts from normal eating.",

The psychic burden of a perception of temporaneous existence leads people to seek it all rather than to give it their all. You can see this is marriages where there use to be an (arguably imbalanced, but beside the point) exchange of responsibilities, duties, and privileges between the sexes.\nRelieving the psychic burden of temporaneous existence, which religion did in the past but often no longer does, will allow people to be much more reasonable in how they formulate their choices, direct their efforts, shape their social contracts and thus generate more robust marriages.",

Refocusing on economic growth isn't just about the benefits mankind would reap in terms of easier, longer, healthier lives lived by more, but also about getting away from their Overton windows, their frames on the world, embracing your own identity and impetus to creation.\nThe NT is most definitely heavily altered. It is even publicly accepted that counsels gathered to determine what to put into the Bible and what to leave out and you better believe they altered the books that were put in and left as much of the truth out as they could.",

Is that one of the best activities to move the cause forward?\nI'm also quite curious about your responses relating to the history of Christianity. I have looked very closely at the text of the Bible, and I see that the New Testament is the most well-attested document in antiquity. We have thousands of copies, quotations and references from the early church, corroboration of historical details in hostile and neutral sources.\nFor the Old Testament, we have copies from the Dead Sea Scrolls, translations, and the text doesn't appear to have changed over the several centuries we can observe (although I suppose it's possible it could have been done before then).\nAnd I observe that the archaeology, historical details, even cultural details like the references to Assyrian Suzerain-Vassal treaties, seem to indicate approximately correct dating.\nAre you saying the text was altered? Or that the narrative was hijacked by Paul, or others before Paul? Are there any sources to look at with this?"

We strongly value the nuclear family and marriage institution for procreating and raising a family, but this is already not really a lifelong activity and as our lives extend into hundreds or thousands of years, the reproductive phase is merely a short episode in one's own life.\nThe attraction that people have to such permanence creating schema will fade as the fear of their own mortality subsides, but the will also invest themselves more intensely in their current relationships.

The religion seems to discourage political involvement and education and in they were involved with the United Nations (that theyâ€™re supposedly against) up until a newspaper called them out on it, which is a red flag for me.\n3.Something that has been bothering me about the Pizzagate... Why did Wikileaks leave the Pizza emails inside? Was it supposed to be a distraction or was it a mistake?\n4. You mentioned on in your earlier threads back in July that Trump will pick someone from the Pentagon. However, Trump picked Pence and from what weâ€™ve seen has no ties to the Pentagon. Did you make a wrong prediction or is Pence from the Pentagon?\n5. Are Hackers (normal person) players inside the world to a degree? Or is it just the agencies/foreign countries that are responsible for hacks? Was the Sony hacks and the Fappening a result of common people?"

The founding fathers were exceedingly good at this sort of thing and the plans to make the revolution successful were laid for decades in advance. Washington's family was heavily invested in iron works for example, knowing they would need the domestic production to fuel the war effort down the line and even placing their foundries in rural, hard to access areas. The history is really rich here in so many ways.",

If you are on the cutting of science, not just reading about it but doing it and solving problems yourself, you are almost like a magician - acquiring skills no one else has.\n2. You could start with Shulgin's works. Read a lot, many perspectives. Try to meet others with some experience that seem like good people and set aside plenty of time to be in a place you are comfortable, then give it a go.\n3. Dreaming is neat - like a daily reminder to you how powerful your mind really is. It takes a lot of work to tap into it. You'll find that many of the great minds have dreamlike consciousness when awake, the ability to synthesize and analyze and run through tremendous amounts of data in an instant. These abilities are widely available, but hardly used.\n4. It is ok to have negative thoughts and feelings, but you should be asking yourself questions about those - what are the problems? What are solutions? What might I study to find them if I can't think of them now?",

Trump is in over his head and doesn't know how to deal with a variety of threats / leverage being used against him.\nYou have a lot of his inner circle like Bannon or Alex Jones playing up silly stuff like Iran boogeyman, Islam as an existential threat, etc. They are pushing to keep the population divided whereas Trump needs to break free of this paradigm and be a president of all the people, not just the ones that voted for him.\nDeeper threats include things like the ongoing possibility of a staged financial crisis that Trump isn't prepared to deal with. He is letting the Fed bully him rather than the other way around for example. He knows that he is unprepared to handle all of this alone, and also that he has no good advisors, so it sort of makes sense for him to cut a deal with the establishment by sacking Flynn until he can get some real help on these fronts.",

    "Message": "In terms of direct democracy, I encourage you to think about this problem not in terms of digital voting but rather digital solutions to bringing free speech back into society for everyone.\nIt's possible to build out a public network that people can connect to and speak on anonymously by developing hardware that is not individually identifiable. When you give people the ability to speak more freely like this, you'll find that whistleblowing becomes a real and systematic thing rather than mostly a limited hangout operation as it is now. Furthermore, there are no shortage of decent, smart people around you but you don't see these ideas in the public discourse because your regime assassinates such people. You can learn about cryptography or anonymous network participation to start thinking about the details of such a system.\nAs to food, this is a problem we can solve with a higher energy throughput economy and moving agricultural production indoors. There is a lot of evil and cynical stuff being done with vaccines, GMOs, etc., but these things are not entirely without merit either. Pests are a hard problem to deal with outdoors, but trivial inside. By moving our agriculture to indoor farming we reduce the toxic effects of pesticides and much of the motivation for GMO as opposed to selective breeding of better yielding crops. Cheap energy will make this transition happen for economics reasons; it is better to be able to grow year round, you get higher yields indoors, and so on.\nBesides cheap energy for powering indoor lightning, the only other real obstacle in the way is water management. This needs to be addressed in big ways with projects like NAWAPA, but a higher energy throughput economy will make a variety of other solutions practicable like desalination plants on coasts distant from mountain ranges.",

There is no reason to pass tax cuts that are overwhelmingly slanted to the rich when you have huge debt liabilities and poor folks struggling to feed themselves.\nOf course I have shown you how we can cut taxes to 0% across the board, and that should be the end game so I am not justifying taxes in the least. But if you are going to cut them piecemeal rather than going big, it is far better to help the people struggling to eat than to give a billionaire many more millions. Not just ethically, but also practically: he can shore up far more support from the people that way which in turn inhibits deep state leverage over him and lets him go further.\nHe isn't acting in a way that will generate a virtuous cycle of successive steps forward at present.\nAs to the question of overplaying their hand on the part of Trump supporters, to some extent you are right. It is possible to roll up the bad guys, but only if you have holistic plans in place to replace the semi-legitimate functions they were carrying out. You can't stop the US government from drug running or fighting petro wars until you have alternative schemes for backing the currency.

The way to address that is to do things like build a space elevator, start growing the economy 10x faster than is usual, and have a government so overwhelmed with surplus that no one has to worry about these scarcity problems anymore.\nWe can get to 0% taxes and free health care for everyone in a few years pretty trivially.

    "Message": "Most folks want to be liked. It's true of Trump as well. They get into office and want at least the illusion of doing well. So there is real tension between presidents and the establishment even with the hackiest of hacks. Sometimes they get killed in office even though they seemed safe and were allowed to get elected earlier.\nThe chaos in the intelligence agencies is really at a much deeper level than pro/anti Trump though. These people all turned into psychopaths and a lot of them are only recently realizing it, if only out of an instinct towards self-preservation.\nSomething a lot of you don't realize is that there isn't much intelligence to be founded in intelligence agencies. Not very bright people at all. They get ahead of themselves and don't figure out how bad they fucked up until the last minute because they finally see almost certain doom staring them in the face.\nSo that's really the big story. A lot of these people are doing double takes, gut checks, sort of snapping out of their illusions of grandeur and realizing how retarded they've been all along. As far as organized coups and counter-coups, no, not really. That's just a bunch of bluster to rebrand the CIA as your friend. (\"we reformed ourselves, all is well now, back to sleep\") Everyone is onto them and these are desperate last grasps at maintaining legitimacy.",

    "Message": "There are all kinds of issues with the bible like mistranslations (accidental or purposeful) even in well-preserved texts. You really need to keep your thinking cap on in such circumstances.\nIs usury horrible for mankind? Yea, clearly. So Jesus probably whipped bankers in the temple. Makes sense right?\nDoes eating bacon or having anal sex mean you need to burn in a pit of fire for eternity? Seems a bit extreme. But those two things have something in common: pigs and anal sex were well known disease transmitters and the idea is that engaging in activity that put your vulnerable community at greater risk was wrong.\nYou can break up some stuff with soundwaves, sure. The problem of dealing with waste in landfills is going to be about as complex as the waste in the landfills though, so you have to be prepared to make the long trek through learning a lot of science. Recycling of metal versus plastic versus organic waste will all have different best practices. You don't necessarily need to know a lot of chemistry to participate however. There are plenty of folks with phds that have their phone numbers posted online - you can call them and ask them to imagine a world where we recycle everything and how finely sorted and into what categories they think would make that work best. Survey 20 of them and see where the consensus is and draft a new and improved set of bins for sorting. The process isn't very granular right now, certainly not as much as it should be. Generally speaking you just want to drop the notion that our problems are too big to overcome. If you don't have the expertise on something, call someone who does and try to have an honest conversation with them. That's a big part of what is absent in our society right now.",

What can I create, with my limited life experience of creation and technical know-how - Or better yet, how can landfills be recycled in to energy? I was imagining soundwaves at low frequency, vibrating trash/landfill material down long passage ways until it's destroyed...
