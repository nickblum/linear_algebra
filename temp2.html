Being part of a network that has been very good to them, as they perceive what is good, and they have a great deal invested in the lie. These are the handlers, controllers, and manipulators who stand to lose a great deal-from their point of view-should the lies be made for what they are. These are the enemies. They are legion. From their view, the system has done well by them and why not keep those under their thumb in a cage of lies? These then become, by their agreed choices, the dark souls following the dark paths. The ice they put out becomes their ice, their bright lights diminish, and until in one life, the light in heart shines out no more. They become hideous and putrid, both outward and inward, until all who gaze upon them find them revolting. In the end, all these have is their will.

This has been an interesting thread.<br><br> Something about blood lines.. .. You constantly hear about the reptilian blood line being RH Negative, that the elites are RH Negative.. is this true?<br></div><span class="c2">Quoting: <strong>CrazyMama73</strong><a class="sm1 sm_text c1" href="/forum1/message1685421/reply27903432" rel="nofollow" title="Go to Quoted Post"></a></span></div><br><br> Oy! CrazyMama 73 appears from the Aether to inform and enlighten!<br><br> Well, Reptilian is an emotionally charged word here, and elsewhere. So please forget the reptilian reference for now and consider the following "facts" and "questions"...<br><br> Who are the "Children of Israel?" Why was their seed blessed? Why were they told not to inter-marry with other people and to circumcise their sons for identification? Why were they told to preserve their geneology? Where did Adam and Eve's sons go to get their wives, if they were the only "humans" on earth?<br><br> Many scientists believe that modern man evolved from ape-like primates. They have much proof to back up their theories, including modern blood analysis and comparative studies between modern man and lower anthripoids, such as the chimpanzee and the Rhesus monkey.<br><br> It has been proven that the majority of mankind (85%) has a blood factor common with the rhesus monkey. This is called rhesus positive blood. Usually shortened to Rh positive. This factor is completely independent from the A, B, 0 blood types.<br><br> In the study of genetics, we find that we can only inherit what our ancestors had...except in the case of environmental or selective mutation. We can have any of numerous combinations of traits inherited from all of our ancestors. Nothing more and nothing less. Therefore, if man and ape evolved from a common ancestor, their blood would have evolved the same way. Blood factors are transmitted with much more biological precision than any other characteristic. It could be argued from scientific scrutiny that modern man and rhesus monkey have had a common ancestor sometime in the "past". All other earthly primates share this Rh factor. But this leaves out the people who are Rh negative. If all mankind evolved from the same ancestor their blood would be compatible. Where did the Rh negatives come from? If they are not the descendants of prehistoric man, could they be the descendants of planetary travelers?<br><br> All animals and other living creatures known to man can breed with any other of their species. Relative size and color makes no difference. Why does infant's haemolytic disease occur in humans if all humans are the same species? Haemolytic disease is the allergic reaction that occurs when an Rh negative mother is carrying a Rh positive child. Her blood builds up antibodies to destroy an ALIEN substance (the same way it would a virus), thereby destroying the infant. Why would a mother's body reject her own offspring? Nowhere else in nature does this occur naturally. This same problem does occur in mules - a cross between a horse and donkey. This fact alone points to the distinct possibility of a cross-breeding between two similar but genetically different species.<br><br> Why does "science" (ie, the little peoples science)fail to explain how Rh negative is possible? Those familiar with blood factors, admit that Rh - humans must at minimum, be a mutation (if not descendants) of a different ancestor. If a mutation, what caused the mutation? Why does it continue with the exact characteristics? Why does it so violently reject the Rh factor, if it was within their own ancestry? Who was this ancestor? Difficulties in determining ethnology are largely overcome by the use of blood group data, for they are a single gene characteristic and not affected by the environment.<br><br> The Basque people of Spain and France have the highest percentage of Rh negative blood. About 30% have (rr) Rh negative and about 60% carry one (r) negative gene. The average is only 15%-Rh negative, while some groups have very little. The Oriental jewish people of Israel, also have a high percent Rh negative, although most other Oriental people have only about 1% Rh negative. The Samaritans and the Black Cochin jewish also have a high percentage of Rh negative blood, although again the Rh negative blood is rare among most black people.<br><br> Could the Basque people be one of these colonies? Or could it have been the original colony on earth? The origin of the Basques is unknown. Their language is unlike any other European language. Some believe that Basque was the original language of the book of Genesis. Some believe it was the original language of the world and possibly of the creator.<br><br> Genesis 6:2 "The sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and took them wives, all of which they chose." Who were the children of these marriages? Genesis 6:4 "God came into the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, and the same became mighty of old." From the King James Bible dictionary we find: "menchildren - men of Israel, male children of God, not children of man - Ex. 34:23." Ex. 34:7 states "The iniquity of the father will be unto the children unto the fourth generation." It is plain that something is inherited, could it be the blood?<br><br><strong class="c4">Blood is mentioned more often than any other word in the Bible</strong>, except God. These two words you will find on almost every page, blood and God! (The blood of the Gods?) This message has been written for thousands of years. There is a connection between the blood and the Gods.<br><br> The American Indians had the tradition of making good friends, "blood brothers", if they thought they were worthy. Could this tradition have been for a reason? Could they have actually been checking to see if they were blood brothers (the same type blood)? The clumping (aggulation) that occurs when Rh positive and Rh negative blood are mixed is visible to the naked eye. Could they have been told, by their ancestors, that their blood was different from that of the rest of mankind except for their brothers and sisters, from other tribes, scattered throughout the earth. Indian tradition declares that their ancestors were of cosmic origin. The Indian totem pole is actually a family genealogy.<br><br> Why all this preoccupation with genealogy among different people scattered throughout the earth? No other animal on earth has this preoccupation with ancestry. Where did this tradition come from? People scattered throughout the earth, who have had no-known contact with each other all simultaneously have the urge to chart their family tree? Why? How important could this have been to primitive cave men? Struggling to survive, to chart their genealogy? They had no understanding of modern genetics and inheritance. So why should they preserve their genealogy? Were they told to preserve their heritage, until a future date when they would return and it would be understood? Until a time, like now, when their descendent would be able to understand the message they were leaving.<br><br> Although they probably didn't realize the importance of preserving their genealogy, they may have believed that future generations would understand. Are we that future generation? Was there a message left for us to understand? Do we have the courage to look for the answer?<br><br> Do we really want to know or would we rather keep our heads buried in the sand? What we don't know will still affect us. You will not see unless you look. Only through knowledge will we find truth.<br><br> Rh negative blood has not evolved on earth in the natural course of events.<br><br> For many years people have been searching for the wrong thing. Could the true "missing link" actually be man himself? The unknown link between earth and the stars - hybrid man. Is man the missing link between primate and extraterrestrial?<br><br> Upon x-raying the tomb of Makare, high priestess of Ammon, it was found that the infant buried with her labeled Prince Moutenihet was actually a female hamadryas baboon. An examination of Makare showed she had given birth shortly before dying.<br><br> Dear Bickle! Start to consider the possibility that you, the Rh positive primate that you are...have only just begun your evolutionary journey. Consider that you are evolving as fast as your little helix can regenerate!<br><br> The "others" who you so misunderstand have engaged you to our mutual benefit and survival!</div></div><div class="postWrap"><div class="postHead"><div class="postAuthor">Rothschild</div><div class="postDetails">User ID: 1339201 United States 11/01/2011 11:45 AM</div></div><div class="postMain"><div class="quoteo"><div class="quotei"><div class="quoteo"><div class="quotei"><div class="quoteo"><div class="quotei">that which you don't know you don't know<br></div><span class="c2">Quoting: <strong>Anonymous Coward 1339201</strong><a class="sm1 sm_text c1" href="/forum1/message1685421/reply27855957" rel="nofollow" title="Go to Quoted Post"></a></span></div><br><br> You Know?<br><br><br></div><span class="c2">Quoting: <strong>Open Your Eyes</strong><a class="sm1 sm_text c1" href="/forum1/message1685421/reply27901761" rel="nofollow" title="Go to Quoted Post"></a></span></div><br><br> I know!

Therefore, if man and ape evolved from a common ancestor, their blood would have evolved the same way. Blood factors are transmitted with much more biological precision than any other characteristic. It could be argued from scientific scrutiny that modern man and rhesus monkey have had a common ancestor sometime in the "past". All other earthly primates share this Rh factor. But this leaves out the people who are Rh negative. If all mankind evolved from the same ancestor their blood would be compatible. Where did the Rh negatives come from? If they are not the descendants of prehistoric man, could they be the descendants of planetary travelers?<br><br> All animals and other living creatures known to man can breed with any other of their species. Relative size and color makes no difference. Why does infant's haemolytic disease occur in humans if all humans are the same species? Haemolytic disease is the allergic reaction that occurs when an Rh negative mother is carrying a Rh positive child. Her blood builds up antibodies to destroy an ALIEN substance (the same way it would a virus), thereby destroying the infant. Why would a mother's body reject her own offspring? Nowhere else in nature does this occur naturally. This same problem does occur in mules - a cross between a horse and donkey. This fact alone points to the distinct possibility of a cross-breeding between two similar but genetically different species.<br><br> Why does "science" (ie, the little peoples science)fail to explain how Rh negative is possible? Those familiar with blood factors, admit that Rh - humans must at minimum, be a mutation (if not descendants) of a different ancestor. If a mutation, what caused the mutation? Why does it continue with the exact characteristics? Why does it so violently reject the Rh factor, if it was within their own ancestry? Who was this ancestor? Difficulties in determining ethnology are largely overcome by the use of blood group data, for they are a single gene characteristic and not affected by the environment.<br><br> The Basque people of Spain and France have the highest percentage of Rh negative blood. About 30% have (rr) Rh negative and about 60% carry one (r) negative gene. The average is only 15%-Rh negative, while some groups have very little. The Oriental jewish people of Israel, also have a high percent Rh negative, although most other Oriental people have only about 1% Rh negative. The Samaritans and the Black Cochin jewish also have a high percentage of Rh negative blood, although again the Rh negative blood is rare among most black people.<br><br> Could the Basque people be one of these colonies? Or could it have been the original colony on earth? The origin of the Basques is unknown. Their language is unlike any other European language. Some believe that Basque was the original language of the book of Genesis. Some believe it was the original language of the world and possibly of the creator.<br><br> Genesis 6:2 "The sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and took them wives, all of which they chose." Who were the children of these marriages? Genesis 6:4 "God came into the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, and the same became mighty of old." From the King James Bible dictionary we find: "menchildren - men of Israel, male children of God, not children of man - Ex. 34:23." Ex. 34:7 states "The iniquity of the father will be unto the children unto the fourth generation." It is plain that something is inherited, could it be the blood?<br><br><strong class="c4">Blood is mentioned more often than any other word in the Bible</strong>, except God. These two words you will find on almost every page, blood and God! (The blood of the Gods?) This message has been written for thousands of years. There is a connection between the blood and the Gods.<br><br> The American Indians had the tradition of making good friends, "blood brothers", if they thought they were worthy. Could this tradition have been for a reason? Could they have actually been checking to see if they were blood brothers (the same type blood)? The clumping (aggulation) that occurs when Rh positive and Rh negative blood are mixed is visible to the naked eye. Could they have been told, by their ancestors, that their blood was different from that of the rest of mankind except for their brothers and sisters, from other tribes, scattered throughout the earth. Indian tradition declares that their ancestors were of cosmic origin. The Indian totem pole is actually a family genealogy.<br><br> Why all this preoccupation with genealogy among different people scattered throughout the earth? No other animal on earth has this preoccupation with ancestry. Where did this tradition come from? People scattered throughout the earth, who have had no-known contact with each other all simultaneously have the urge to chart their family tree? Why? How important could this have been to primitive cave men? Struggling to survive, to chart their genealogy? They had no understanding of modern genetics and inheritance. So why should they preserve their genealogy? Were they told to preserve their heritage, until a future date when they would return and it would be understood? Until a time, like now, when their descendent would be able to understand the message they were leaving.<br><br> Although they probably didn't realize the importance of preserving their genealogy, they may have believed that future generations would understand. Are we that future generation? Was there a message left for us to understand? Do we have the courage to look for the answer?<br><br> Do we really want to know or would we rather keep our heads buried in the sand? What we don't know will still affect us. You will not see unless you look. Only through knowledge will we find truth.<br><br> Rh negative blood has not evolved on earth in the natural course of events.<br><br> For many years people have been searching for the wrong thing. Could the true "missing link" actually be man himself? The unknown link between earth and the stars - hybrid man. Is man the missing link between primate and extraterrestrial?<br><br> Upon x-raying the tomb of Makare, high priestess of Ammon, it was found that the infant buried with her labeled Prince Moutenihet was actually a female hamadryas baboon. An examination of Makare showed she had given birth shortly before dying.<br><br> Dear Bickle! Start to consider the possibility that you, the Rh positive primate that you are...have only just begun your evolutionary journey. Consider that you are evolving as fast as your little helix can regenerate!<br><br> The "others" who you so misunderstand have engaged you to our mutual benefit and survival!<br></div><span class="c2">Quoting: <strong>Anonymous Coward 1339201</strong><a class="sm1 sm_text c1" href="/forum1/message1685421/reply27915816" rel="nofollow" title="Go to Quoted Post"></a></span></div><br><br> You speak not with forked tongue here.

Thomas Watson Sr was the leader of International Business Machines (IBM), a corporate entity closely tied to the US military. Supposedly, an employee made a huge mistake costing the company millions of dollars (back when that meant something). The employee was summoned to Watson's office and assumed he was going to be fired. Watson Sr asked the employee to explain what happened and what he had learned, and then told him to go back to work. The employee was flabbergasted and told Watson that he had expected to be terminated. Watson said "I just spent 10 million dollars on your education! Do you think I want a competitor of IBM to benefit from that education?"<br><br> Think about how well you will be able to advise and guide your son! He is lucky to have a man of your "real world" experience to guide and mentor him! It is doubtful you will be spouting useless platitudes and harmless untruths!

A kernel of "truth and knowledge" emerges, from whatever source, and immediately a swarm of humans take that kernel and grind it into a useless meal. It is quite perplexing, but an example of some self-styled "messiah" trying to emerge as a leader for usually selfish reasons. Humans are quick to sacrifice their own at the altar of "beautiful lies" for even the smallest advantage!<br><br> For many years, human governments were pitted one against the other...resulting in wars, famine and poverty...except for the banking classes! They benefited greatly from war! And still do. As the era of the nation state comes to a close...on the cusp of a global world order...competing nations will give way to class warfare and ultimately competing bloodlines. Poor Chinese will hate rich chinese...poor americans will hate rich americans...europeans the same. Poor will wage war against the "rich" much larger scale than nation states.

A kernel of "truth and knowledge" emerges, from whatever source, and immediately a swarm of humans take that kernel and grind it into a useless meal. It is quite perplexing, but an example of some self-styled "messiah" trying to emerge as a leader for usually selfish reasons. Humans are quick to sacrifice their own at the altar of "beautiful lies" for even the smallest advantage!<br><br> For many years, human governments were pitted one against the other...resulting in wars, famine and poverty...except for the banking classes! They benefited greatly from war! And still do. As the era of the nation state comes to a close...on the cusp of a global world order...competing nations will give way to class warfare and ultimately competing bloodlines. Poor Chinese will hate rich chinese...poor americans will hate rich americans...europeans the same. Poor will wage war against the "rich" much larger scale than nation states. Perhaps you are seeing this play out now!<br><br> Laughing out loud!<br><br> 2) Distractions, all. And yes, there are portals, but not what you imagine!<br><br> 3) The musician, John Lennon asked that very question in his music.."can man live without his illusions"? A very dangerous question! But one you must answer for yourself....and your progeny!<br><br> 4) The filters are there for a reason. Figure out the reason and you will have your answer. CLUE: FEAR BASED! Children are programmed from birth to respond to FEAR!

There must be something going on that does NOT benefit if you guys want to distract us.. But why?<br><br> 3: A dangerous question, for who? A dangerous question for the person in question because the "ego" see's it as danger because it's an outside of the box question? Or a dangerous question for you guys if we ask that our self?<br><br> 4: I know that they are there for a reason, I also know it's fear based, because every time we get "fear" we let our Reptilian brain (survival mode) take over, we are literally clicking backwards with our Amygdala into our Reptilian brain, instead of clicking forward into our Frontal Lobe. Am I right about the fact that the reptilian brain is a HUGE part in the manipulations? I must say, I get chills on my body if I see how perfectly planned this is, and effective.. I got respect for it, but not for the purpose it's been used, but that's a different thing!<br> Am I also right if I say that our EGO get's trapped by the Fight/Flee working of the Reptilian brain?<br><br> Got a new question:<br><br> 5. How do YOU look at us humans? Do you see us as less, or the same? Do you feel sorry for us? Do you have a sense of guild? Do you ever think about you abusing humans as a highly race? I know we are doing the same, but if you posses the knowledge for unconditional love and you are conscious of it, and that with out it you create pain, than I don't understand (from my point of view) why you do not use this.. If I got the choice to give up EVERYTHING I have, to just taste a little of this knowledge, I would give it all (IF I knew I could use it for GOOD purpose ofcourse) If you are reptilian, is it true that you don't have a MEMMAL brain, and could that be the reason why you can live with your self, without have a feeling of guild?<br><br> If you choose to believe the "lessons" of the MATRIX, feel free! <strong>I have told you what I know to be the truth</strong>...do with it what you will.</div><span class="c2">Quoting: <strong>Mindfulnesz</strong><a class="sm1 sm_text c1" href="/forum1/message1685421/reply27919926" rel="nofollow" title="Go to Quoted Post"></a></span></div><br><br> So you don't even know if your truth is the truth so your truth may be not true, where does that leave you?<br> And how do you know, that YOU don't live in an illusion (just like us) and the same thing happens to you? Hahahah That would be ironic, the energy harvesters getting harvested :P No but serious, if you speak the truth about you guys harvesting us (with out us knowing), then how the fuck do you know that you don't get harvested/manipulated, ever thought about that? I was never comfortable seeing the world as it is with all the violence and pain, because if WE do it, WHO else is doing it and on what level? Aren't you uncomfortable by your own actions, and not afraid it happens to you? Well I did my whole life, and look at it now, I'm about to learn THAT IT IS.

Look for Syria next to fall, and fall quickly.<br><br> North Korea has already cut a deal under the aegis of China...feit accompli. Cuba has also agreed to the North American integration once Fidel "passes".<br><br> That leaves IRAN. And biblical prophesy. The fallout from that conflict sets the stage for the true new world order as has been broadcast in the media for the last 13 years or so.<br><br> 3) Of course, humans have free will. However, free will without intelligence, imagination and the "will" to evolve is meaningless. Similar to giving an infant the keys to a vehicle...what are they going to do with all that potential?<br><br> Look to the routines in your own life and ask what YOU do with YOUR free will to improve your bloodline...<br></div><span class="c2">Quoting: <strong>Anonymous Coward 1339201</strong><a class="sm1 sm_text c1" href="/forum1/message1685421/reply27950955" rel="nofollow" title="Go to Quoted Post"></a></span></div><br><br><strong>for 2nd Q:</strong><br><em>The purpose of the world government is to assert total control of the "masses" and harvest their "energy".</em><br> Are'nt you already doing that?

You provide a minimum level of sustenance to maximize the "yield"...nothing more or less. You take care of the herd, but they also don't live in your space or partake of your "pleasures". They serve you at your pleasure. If you choose to slaughter...or milk...it is your decision and yours alone. You answer to no one, other than your family.<br><br> Psychedelics are an interesting topic. Synthetics, such as LSD-25 and its derivatives are useless noise.<br><br> DMT is the real deal. Ayuasca is one route, but requires rigorous rituals prior which most ignore. The shamans understand.<br><br> The problem without the preparations is that there is no framework of reference or understanding. You can access great historical works which explain much, but if you do not know the language in which they are written, it is a fruitless experience.

The best thing that could happen to canada is if the "native" canadians were shipped somewhere (or drowned like the vermin they are) and the land populated with Asians. I prefer Japanese due to their industrious nature, but chinese follow directions well and cause few disturbances to the status quo.<br><br> Regardless, to your question(s).<br><br> 1) One does not "deal" with competition.

Is influencing the outcome of such an event the highest and best use of this so-called GIFT? Are there not more pressing issues with which to apply your talents?<br><br> Let's look from another perspective. The heavily favored team lost because you willed it so, or so you state. Presumably they were heavily favored because they possessed talent more than the lesser ranked team. Why? Maybe they came from better stock, because the players ancestors made better decisions and passed on better genes. Perhaps the players themselves worked harder, had more dedication or were physically superior.<br><br> Maybe the better team had a better coach. The University invested money which could have been spent in other areas but decided the publicity and fame was a superior investment in the Universities future.<br><br> Whatever, the higher ranked team was superior in some important ways, and that evaluation was borne out by the results being displayed by those assembled to watch the contest. The better tram was winning, as expected!<br><br> Then, according to your fanciful tale, YOU intervened and changed the inevitable outcome FOR NO GOOD REASON.<br><br> You had some arbitrary emotional attachment to see the weaker, less qualified team win! You then intervened to obtain your frivolous desire at the expense of the better teams efforts.<br><br> Consider possible downstream developments. The better team players become disheartened and quit basketball...giving up their true nature and talent. The lesser team develops an unrealistic expectation which cannot be sustained.<br><br> There are a million scenarios...choose one.<br><br> You would appear to be severely delusional, best case or a pathological liar.

Everyone on the bus agrees they want to get to the game where they can have a "shot" at fame and glory!!<br><br> Let's further imagine that there is not a hired driver but that each sports participant will get a turn at the steering wheel!<br><br> You can imagine with the variety of personalities on the bus that some will be diligent and drive directly at top speed! Others may get distracted! Some may stop excessively to eat and satisfy some psychological craving they have. Others are drunks! and wish to stop at every pub along the way and drink to excess. Not only do these people delay the progress of the team in reaching their destination, but their dissolute living puts the entire team at risk of accident and death. The selfish ones care little as long as their needs are met!<br><br> Some drivers might stop to assist their stranded fellow traveler! What a good guy! However, in doing so they delay the progress of their fellow team mates! Certainly, the one providing the service looks the hero and collects accolades, but he has done a disservice to the others on the bus to satisfy the ego. From the viewpoint of the teammates, it is a selfish act.<br><br> By now even the dullards here MUST gather the meaning. Bickle, I'm looking at you.<br><br> The bus is of course the bloodline. Ancestors and those yet to come are all helpless passengers as each bloodline member gets their turn at the wheel! You are free to do as you want...free will and all that...but everyone on your team will pay a price for your choices...such as they are!<br><br> What will you do with YOUR TURN?<br><br> NOW! Let's say that the other team knows your bus is full of lower form primates who respond to their base instincts. So the opposition team, being the black-hearts they are, erect a billboard advertising young women who will dance and writhe for your pleasure! And serve alcohol until you are stupid! Hooray!<br><br> Who is responsible for the team bus now parked in that parking lot?

And of course robbed of their efforts.<br><br> So, suppose you would approach a person in the former manner rather than the manner described in the honey-bee analogy, what would you be looking for?<br><br> Or is your Family so pervasive that none merits such an approach?<br><br> Can you tell me the purpose of money in the sense of maintaining governments and ruling systems? I also am well aware that money in the sense it is known in most of the insider/elite family threads is merely propagandized.<br><br> I think money in nature is a way to track favors. The more money you have the more favors people owe you upon the receiving of the informing item i.e. the federal reserve note.<br><br> I think also that money was based on a righteous moral decision.<br><br> That is, it can be refused, and the receiver has the option of refusing a deal put in monetary term, all compelling social and material conditions aside. (i.e. the person offering the money is a scary gangster, or it is a desperate young woman offering money for shelter during pregnancy)<br><br> The human species by its nature responds well to favor and influence. The invention of money (which I am sure is a great intellectual victory in its own to whomever achieved it) is merely a solidifying of this instinct.<br><br> To have a society that does not recognize the favor of others under compulsion is to have a perfectly normal human society.<br><br> To have a society that recognizes contacts and places of favor and bribes is very healthy.<br><br> Rules that are absolute are ones that assert themselves by instinct rather than outside behaviour and motivations.<br><br> The Law of gravitation for example (distinguished from gravity in the physical sense) and many other things.<br><br> I would then ask you to tell me what you think of these things.<br><br> I would like to ask (if it is not too much) about the importance of externalizing certain aspects of the Human animal to its conscious and subconscious brain.

First, you must understand that words have MEANING.<br><br> You use the word VIRTUE! What is that, exactly? Can you give an example in the animal kingdom, other than humans, where virtue is manifest?<br><br> Is virtue, as you understand it, a good or bad thing, and from what perspective?<br><br> Money is a tool, like all others, except that it is imbued with "mystical" powers. The establishment of central banks is ALWAYS a necessary first step of subjugation of geographically congregated bloodlines. Note that Libya's first official act, before even the corpses turned stiff...was the establishment of a central bank. Those rebel forces were certainly well schooled by someone!<br><br> Think of the psycho-sexual representations of money in a typical society! Think of what energy and representations come from these artificial contrivances!<br><br> Money has come to represent stature, security, control, image, power, influence and almost every one of the seven deadly sins!<br><br> Laughing out loud!<br><br> Fiat is sexmoneymagic! It is the false god of culture! it is all-consuming and self-sustaining. It expands effortlessly like the elastic waistband of an obese american!<br><br> Now consider how much energy is expended in its pursuit and how much misery (negative energy) has come from this simple piece of paper!<br><br> Think of negative energy (suffering, misery, poverty...like your pregnant woman in a storm analogy!) and positive energy (happiness, money, wealth, power...new car!!!)<br><br> Do you understand a chemical battery storage system?

If the color points...dots...are true and vibrant, if the artist is diligent and has the requisite talent, if great care is taken! A masterpiece might be born.<br><br> The masterpiece resonates from the true-ness and correct-ness of its authenticity! It was not created in "one sunday afternoon in the park" nor was it slap-dash in its construction. Seurat spent much time in its composition, the selection of colors and hues, the medium...and everything else relating to the work at hand. No doubt during the time of his work, he focused his passion and attention on his work...likely at the expense of social interactions, family and other outside interests!<br><br> This man doubtlessly put all else out of his mind for an extended period to complete his great work! He was not on the internet, tele, texting, video gaming or otherwise relaxing.<br><br> And yes, Bickle, you twit, I am aware this was done prior to the technological innovations you all now so enjoy! However, there were other distractions of his day...such as Opium!<br><br> Laughing out loud!<br><br> Anyway, although Seurat had a blank canvas and selected his materials with great care, he still was bound by certain of the conventions of the art world and his time. Of course, he could have chosen to do abstract or other styles...BUT HE DESIRED TO ELICIT A CERTAIN EMOTIONAL RESPONSE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE VIEWER!<br><br> As such, he was required to conform to certain conventions of art...NATURAL LAWS, if you will!<br><br> Free will of the artist, free expression joined with respect to the NATURAL LAWS. A masterpiece was created.<br><br> Note that this all occurred with great sacrifice, great purpose and great planning. It was no accident!<br><br> So, Miss Egypt! Understand that the great tapestry which has unfurled before you is similar in many threads combining to create a great whole. The thread placement was no accident...but you cannot understand the tapestry, or the painting, by intently studying one thread, or one colorful dot and hope to understand the methods and objectives of the artist or weaver!<br><br> Silly, silly, silly!!<br><br> So, can you understand that one dot does not define the painting as one "observation" does not define a strategy!<br><br> Now, let's say that you are attempting to create a Seurat of your own. You have the blank canvas of an open mind (i'm giving you an undeservedly huge leap of faith here!) and have carefully selected your colors and oils, (which would be, metaphorically, the data and information you have collected, your "dots" or "threads" to create your great work!)<br><br> You begin, carefully and are making some progress!<br><br> Now, the door flies open and a small child rambunctiously runs into your studio! As he runs about leaving a trail of chaos and destruction in his wake, other children enter the room and begin to "dot" your painting without regard to your efforts, strategy or global color scheme! Undifferentiated paint placement! Dots of all shapes and sizes randomly placed!<br><br> Your canvas painting, following the edicts of art nature and your conventions, are doomed!<br><br> So, follow the mind exercise to its logical conclusion.<br><br> YOU CANNOT SEE THE GLOBAL PICTURE BY FIXATING ON THE DOTS OR THREADS of individual data points or observations!<br><br> Further, your most sincere effort to understand the "truth" will be for naught if you allow young children to run amok in your "gallery". And for the dim-witted among you, the children running amok is, of course, the INTERNET! Many children with data dots spewing freely all over your canvas...<br><br> If one were cynical, one might conclude, correctly, that the entire internet is the perfect disinformation machine because the inmates themselves are creating the disinformation! Throw out one scrap of "information", one data-point....and the unwashed masses are on it like jackals on scraps!<br><br> Why, you might ask? Well, pick any human "virtue" and you can form your own conclusions...not to mention NEWSLETTERS!<br><br> Laughing out loud!<br><br> Humans are so stupid, they delude themselves...over and over again! We aren't even required to make the effort!<br><br> Stupid...stupid...stupid!!!<br><br> Yes, that beloved guardian of free information, free love, the american way and yes...PORN!<br><br> Laughing out loud!<br><br> Yes, indeed. We know all too well what the great truth seekers of your time are doing with all that high speed connectivity! And it "ain't" searching for anything close to the truth!<br><br> Laughing out loud!!<br><br> Can you imagine what the great scientists (and artists) of HISTORY!! da Vinci, Galileo, Mozart, Plato etc. would have done with the MASSIVE computing power residing in even the most base cell phone of today? These great thinkers figured out things with only their wits and careful observations! Now, an entire global informational database, such as it is, can be delivered in fractions of a second to the comfort of your chair. You don't even have to move! And what do the guardians of the republic do with such knowledge and power? Watch other humans copulate in a variety of scenarios!<br><br> It truly is hard to fathom what motivates you little folk! Seriously, is it not true that you "have seen one you have seen them all"? Is one penis or vagina significantly different than another? LOTS of attention paid to pornography! If one has limited "clock-cycles", how will advancement come from such frivolous undertakings?<br><br> Can you see how you are damned, DAMNED, BECAUSE of the fact you have all the tools necessary...the resources...to determine the fate and safety of your bloodline!<br><br> Should you choose, for whatever reason, to not avail yourself, all blame falls to you and others are fully ABSOLVED!<br><br> Humans of today have almost unlimited resources and tools at their disposal! few worry about sanitary conditions or full bellies! And what has been done with this great bounty?<br><br> NOTHING!<br><br> How can you plead your case??? To what authority will such an argument hold sway??<br><br> Believe what you want...the "beautiful lie"...but you are in a state of terminal self delusion! And by terminal, I am offering the most optimistic assessment of your current state!<br><br> The effort must be made...some sacrifice, to be sure, but well within the capabilities of all! And yet, here you find yourself!</div></div><div class="postWrap"><div class="postHead"><div class="postAuthor">Rothschild</div><div class="postDetails">User ID: 1339201 United States 12/28/2011 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="postMain"><div class="quoteo"><div class="quotei">Am I a cockroach to which you feferred to earlier?<br></div><span class="c2">Quoting: <strong>Geolobo 7766273</strong><a class="sm1 sm_text c1" href="/forum1/message1685421/reply28794437" rel="nofollow" title="Go to Quoted Post"></a></span></div><br><br> Are you Gregor Samsa by chance?<br><br> Laughing out loud!</div></div><div class="postWrap"><div class="postHead"><div class="postAuthor">Rothschild</div><div class="postDetails">User ID: 1339201 United States 12/28/2011 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="postMain"><div class="quoteo"><div class="quotei"><div class="quoteo"><div class="quotei">Am I a cockroach to which you feferred to earlier?<br></div><span class="c2">Quoting: <strong>Geolobo 7766273</strong><a class="sm1 sm_text c1" href="/forum1/message1685421/reply28794437" rel="nofollow" title="Go to Quoted Post"></a></span></div><br><br> Are you Gregor Samsa by chance?<br><br> Laughing out loud!<br></div><span class="c2">Quoting: <strong>Anonymous Coward 1339201</strong><a class="sm1 sm_text c1" href="/forum1/message1685421/reply28809051" rel="nofollow" title="Go to Quoted Post"></a></span></div><br><br> Upon reflection, you would be better served if you were!

Once it is put out there, it has to be dealt with on its own terms.<br><br> I have already addressed the issue of so-called "selfishness" in some depth. The act of "selflessness" is just that...an act. Programming put out by various self interested parties and institutions. It does not exist in Nature, which is where you need to take your cues from.<br><br> When one accumulates a surplus of resources, why would it be "human nature" to release these to an unrelated other without parity consideration? You likely notice that so called benefactors of one form and another do receive compensation of sorts...peer recognition, status and, almost always, some form of quid pro quo...unseen and withheld from the unwashed masses.<br><br> laughing out loud!<br><br> Selfishness and selflessness are artificial constructs! As I posted earlier in the thread, please provide one such example of selflessness occurring in Nature...even one! Existing outside of the bloodline, that is.<br><br> When a hawk captures a field mouse and feeds its young, no one thinks anything to be amiss. Clearly, the hawk benefits by protecting its progeny, the young benefit by virtue of surviving and only the mouse, in its death, loses.<br><br> Was the mouse selfless in its sacrifice? Not quite...it was stupid (in being exposed) and had insufficient defenses to protect itself. The parent mice spent their lives doing things other than teaching the young how to avoid hawks.<br><br> In terms of your second question, the bloodline can be traced back to the very beginning. Because YOU cannot do so, or do not attach significance to recording and disseminating such information, does not mean others act the same way!<br><br> Notice that in the Old Testament, a significant amount of detail is accorded to the lineage in the very beginning. Have you bothered to read this? Have you wondered why it was so important that it receives so much attention in such a revered document?<br><br> Of course, were you to understand the importance of bloodlines, you would know that, uniformly, family clans in both east and west regard bloodlines to be the determinant of station, position and inheritance. Royalty descends from royalty. Peerage, and all that.<br><br> Slaves of all sorts and colors also, and usually in vain, tried to keep track of the history of their families. Mormons are doing thins in the United States, and have noted that various "interest groups" have been noted to be introducing "noise" into the process.<br><br> I wonder why that would be??<br><br> Laughing out loud!</div></div><div class="postWrap"><div class="postHead"><div class="postAuthor">Rothschild</div><div class="postDetails">User ID: 1339201 United States 02/01/2012 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="postMain">Hello Teschen,<br><br> I believe you oversimplified the animal analogy...used because it is SIMPLE, and easy to grasp.<br><br> Do not ignore YOUR animal behavior!

Souls are vessels for consciousness.<br><br> They are given bodies to experience the physical. Both mouse and hawk will<br> be indwellt by very young and small souls. Their lifes are so simple,<br> they offer very little in terms of ethical choices. Animals eating each<br> other can't be viewed in terms of sacrifice etc because sacrifice is a<br> complex emotion. These animals are just too simple for that.<br><br> Maybe mother hawk/mouse could "sacrifice" herself in defence of the<br> young - still I'd argue it's more down to primitive instinct than moral<br> choice.<br><br> You might say that soul before entering the baby hawk made the choice of<br> service to self orientation - because hawks prey upon other creatures.<br> But once you're a hawk - you have NO choice - you have to prey. You<br> can't eat plants because you're not adapted to it - you're a killing<br> machine for a lifetime.<br><br> So to sum it up - yes they are the same thing - physically, at the soul<br> level they might be a bit different, and no there's no sacrifice, the mouse<br> simply lost in the lottery of life.<br><br> Hope this answers your question.<br></div><span class="c2">Quoting: <strong>teschen</strong><a class="sm1 sm_text c1" href="/forum1/message1685421/reply29442521" rel="nofollow" title="Go to Quoted Post"></a></span></div><br><br> Hello Teschen,<br><br> Why do you suppose these electron clouds aggregate in different forms then?

Take human comfort, for example. You have likely heard of the STOCKHOLM SYNDROME...an interesting manifestation when humans are under some sort of duress....economic, physical, emotional...<br><br> In this case, the captive may develop unusual bonds with their captor. The kidnapped may form emotional alliances with those creating the oppression! AND FURTHER THE AIMS OF THEIR OPPRESSORS!<br><br> Humans seek approval, even from those who seek to oppress them! Humans crave to fit into, and meet, expectations...regardless (as it turns out) who/what so creates these expectations!<br><br> Humans need, and seek, roles in society which serve to define them and define their station in life. Once a human is so "engaged", they will stop at nothing to please their "superiors".<br><br> Take the role of surveillance in modern society (I refer here to video/checkpoints/"papers please" and the like). Is it necessary from our perspective??? NO. There is a cost to surveillance, as there is to all things, and every action causes a reaction...often creating other issues falling under the law of unintended consequences! We are VERY careful introducing new elements into controlled situations!<br><br> The surveillance system was not of our creation! It is your fellow humans seeking to protect their fiefdoms and monitor the activities of potential rivals!<br><br> Read about the "American" who was instrumental in establishing the FBI many years ago. As the story is now told, he created files and surveillance for political and personal reasons! The head of this bureaucracy was known for his predilections ...his love of men and desire to dress in women's clothes!<br><br> Laughing out loud!<br><br> Most would consider that his eccentricities would not qualify him to stand in judgment of others, but there it is. Do you think someone subject to his particular form of abuse might benefit by knowing this? Could the captor not be controlled by someone in possession of such knowledge? Check! and Checkmate!<br><br> During the last great European war, the Polish population were oppressed by the National Socialist party, and the tool of oppression was none other than...wait for it...other Polish! Examples of this are rife in human history and easy to find. Why would the Polish people turn on their own? Small comforts and the approval of their oppressors.<br><br> The genius of the system established is the illusion of freedom and having humans act as their own jailers! It is amazing, even to us, how well the system functions.<br><br> However, as demonstrated above, those with just the slightest benefits accorded to them were ALL TOO EAGER to further subjugate their FELLOWS! Which continues apace.<br><br> Laughing out loud!<br><br> Of course, <strong>we</strong> take the blame although we see no value in surveillance of this nature. It means nothing to us. We are more interested in controlling the course of "human events"<br><br> Laughing out loud!<br><br> Those humans who feed off their peers (cannibals, in a sense) consume with a ravenous appetite which puts us to shame. They enjoy the sense of power and humiliation over those subjugated!<br><br> What will evolve, and very quickly as it now looks, is that they will learn, painfully, the magic of what we learned eons ago...the magic of incremental, almost Infinitesimal rates of change! It must be this way...and they will pay a dear price!<br><br> As to your current situation, you may discover that these same oppressors also function under the laws of cowardice. That is to say, it is exactly the ILLUSION of control and power which makes it so. You may, at your discretion, choose to opt out at any time you decide that you refuse to further participate!<br><br> Of course, under the order of NATURAL LAW you are free to do so at any time! It is your free will to do so.<br><br> I ask you, have you made ANY concrete effort to express your will in this regard?<br><br> And consider the Kyoto Effect! Any small action YOU take to change the course of your bloodline will have effects impossible for you to now comprehend. Remember that the longest journey begins with a small step.</div></div><div class="postWrap"><div class="postHead"><div class="postAuthor">Rothschild</div><div class="postDetails">User ID: 1339201 United States 02/21/2012 06:57 PM</div></div><div class="postMain"><div class="quoteo"><div class="quotei"><div class="quoteo"><div class="quotei"><div class="quoteo"><div class="quotei"><div class="quoteo"><div class="quotei"><strong>...</strong><br><br><br> I actually think OP is my real biological father.<br><br> THAT is the most shocking reveal.<br></div><span class="c2">Quoting: <strong>Open Your Eyes</strong><a class="sm1 sm_text c1" href="/forum1/message1685421/reply29738448" rel="nofollow" title="Go to Quoted Post"></a></span></div><br><br> that would be a shocking reveal! that would probably come after the epic light-sabre battle between the two of you.<br></div><span class="c2">Quoting: <strong>Anonymous Coward 11199171</strong><a class="sm1 sm_text c1" href="/forum1/message1685421/reply29738720" rel="nofollow" title="Go to Quoted Post"></a></span></div><br><br> And I would win of course!<br><br><br><br><br></div><span class="c2">Quoting: <strong>Open Your Eyes</strong><a class="sm1 sm_text c1" href="/forum1/message1685421/reply29738831" rel="nofollow" title="Go to Quoted Post"></a></span></div><br><br> oh look, you chose yoda and the emperor to illustrate the point.<br></div><span class="c2">Quoting: <strong>Anonymous Coward 11199171</strong><a class="sm1 sm_text c1" href="/forum1/message1685421/reply29739549" rel="nofollow" title="Go to Quoted Post"></a></span></div><br><br> Laughing out Loud!<br><br> Yes, the characters Mr. Bickle has enlisted in his defense have created an impenetrable wall of logic I am unable to scale!<br><br> Bickle, there is a fellow delusionist posting under the nom de plume KNIGHTS TEMPLAR.

Woman is indicative of one woman, and women is multiple.<br><br> These are simple concepts to grasp, Bickle.

Take human comfort, for example. You have likely heard of the STOCKHOLM SYNDROME...an interesting manifestation when humans are under some sort of duress....economic, physical, emotional...<br><br> In this case, the captive may develop unusual bonds with their captor. The kidnapped may form emotional alliances with those creating the oppression! AND FURTHER THE AIMS OF THEIR OPPRESSORS!<br><br> Humans seek approval, even from those who seek to oppress them! Humans crave to fit into, and meet, expectations...regardless (as it turns out) who/what so creates these expectations!<br><br> Humans need, and seek, roles in society which serve to define them and define their station in life. Once a human is so "engaged", they will stop at nothing to please their "superiors".<br><br> Take the role of surveillance in modern society (I refer here to video/checkpoints/"papers please" and the like). Is it necessary from our perspective??? NO. There is a cost to surveillance, as there is to all things, and every action causes a reaction...often creating other issues falling under the law of unintended consequences! We are VERY careful introducing new elements into controlled situations!<br><br> The surveillance system was not of our creation! It is your fellow humans seeking to protect their fiefdoms and monitor the activities of potential rivals!<br><br> Read about the "American" who was instrumental in establishing the FBI many years ago. As the story is now told, he created files and surveillance for political and personal reasons! The head of this bureaucracy was known for his predilections ...his love of men and desire to dress in women's clothes!<br><br> Laughing out loud!<br><br> Most would consider that his eccentricities would not qualify him to stand in judgment of others, but there it is. Do you think someone subject to his particular form of abuse might benefit by knowing this? Could the captor not be controlled by someone in possession of such knowledge? Check! and Checkmate!<br><br> During the last great European war, the Polish population were oppressed by the National Socialist party, and the tool of oppression was none other than...wait for it...other Polish! Examples of this are rife in human history and easy to find. Why would the Polish people turn on their own? Small comforts and the approval of their oppressors.<br><br> The genius of the system established is the illusion of freedom and having humans act as their own jailers! It is amazing, even to us, how well the system functions.<br><br> However, as demonstrated above, those with just the slightest benefits accorded to them were ALL TOO EAGER to further subjugate their FELLOWS! Which continues apace.<br><br> Laughing out loud!<br><br> Of course, <strong>we</strong> take the blame although we see no value in surveillance of this nature. It means nothing to us. We are more interested in controlling the course of "human events"<br><br> Laughing out loud!<br><br> Those humans who feed off their peers (cannibals, in a sense) consume with a ravenous appetite which puts us to shame. They enjoy the sense of power and humiliation over those subjugated!<br><br> What will evolve, and very quickly as it now looks, is that they will learn, painfully, the magic of what we learned eons ago...the magic of incremental, almost Infinitesimal rates of change! It must be this way...and they will pay a dear price!<br><br> As to your current situation, you may discover that these same oppressors also function under the laws of cowardice. That is to say, it is exactly the ILLUSION of control and power which makes it so. You may, at your discretion, choose to opt out at any time you decide that you refuse to further participate!<br><br> Of course, under the order of NATURAL LAW you are free to do so at any time! It is your free will to do so.<br><br> I ask you, have you made ANY concrete effort to express your will in this regard?<br><br> And consider the Kyoto Effect! Any small action YOU take to change the course of your bloodline will have effects impossible for you to now comprehend.

The success of those implementing such systems resides in the human tendency towards self compliance!<br><br> Someone posted a short video of a driver who refused to answer even the most basic questions when stopped at a Driving While Intoxicated checkpoint. Of course, under the US Constitution such stops without PROBABLE CAUSE are not legal. Firstly, 9 people out of 10 have not taken the time to read the Constitution, so they do not know their rights and thus do not know what statutory laws apply to them or not.<br><br> So rule one would be to learn the rights accorded to you under the highest applicable law. Example, a township statute cannot trump the Constitutional law.<br><br> Once a person is aware of their RIGHTS and DUTIES under the law, they know what laws and duties apply to them.<br><br> Second, if a demand is made not in compliance with the law, the person MUST refuse the request...ie, exercise their rights under the law. The driver in the example above did just that. After a few minutes of noise, the cop waved the drive through the checkpoint!<br><br> If even 3 out of 10 refused to comply, the checkpoints would come down! Systems of oppression require voluntary compliance! Remember that ratio...30% non compliance kills a voluntary system!<br><br> A golden nugget for those so awake.<br><br> Does the Constitution require a passport? Do all of the illegal aliens flooding into the US have the proper paperwork? No? Then why do YOU feel compelled to comply? Are you willing to cross the border as they do? No?

He states without equivocation that the outcome of ANY major trade made by connected institutions is pre-ordained. They KNOW before-hand what the results WILL be because they control the variables that drive the outcome. An unemotional, and correct, assessment.<br><br> What does Das do with the knowledge? THAT is the question!<br> Think of all the so-called financial "experts" who pour over charts and make "expert" recommendations based on what happened in the "past"! And the truly clueless will follow this worthless "advice". It's all nonsense! If one discovers that the financial markets are rigged…i.e., they are not truly free markets which discover and set pricing based on underlying fundamentals between two knowledgeable and comparably situated individuals…one would approach the financial market with a different operating objective, correct?<br><br> In other words, if Das understands that all trades will have a specific outcome decided by those in power, he will (assuming he is not a fool) focus on obtaining that same information the powerful have (or ascertain their intentions) rather than studying traditional metrics on which the uninformed rely in "betting" on the outcomes!<br> Is this not logical? One must clearly grasp the desired outcome of any situation, understand the underlying mechanizations which determine the outcome, and execute ones actions and choices accordingly.<br><br> Simple!<br><br> Now on to your question. Your experience dealing with the health issue described has been most instructive to you, and yet there is still a sense of disbelief on your part.<br> Understand this truth. Humans were "pre-destined" to operate under the NATURAL LAW, of which FREE WILL is an essential element. KARMA is an operational element of FREE WILL, but not in the sense that most humans understand or imagine it to be. Making choices implies results and consequences! KARMA (and the others) have been distorted from their true sense. KARMA does not mean that humans are "doomed" to their future! KARMA means there are consequences to choices made! How could it be otherwise?<br><br> Your post indicates that you have attained some awareness! But you have much to learn.<br><br> Start by re-reading (or reading) the elements I posted relating to the illusion of time. THINK on that!<br> You have already learned a very valuable lesson! YOU (or others) CREATE your reality! THAT is truth!<br> Accepting this reality, it is YOUR choice whether YOU or (an)other CREATE the reality in which you "exist". YOURS….or you can "farm" that duty out to OTHERS.<br><br> Just absorb that one fact! There is no escape from this! YOU, or (an)other WILL create YOUR REALITY!<br><br> Everyone may freely choose, but assume you let (an)other create your reality:<br><br> 1) Do you think that this OTHER would build a reality to your benefit, or to the benefit of the OTHER?<br><br> 2) If the OTHER is delegated responsibility to create YOUR reality, and does so…and that reality is in some (or many) ways detrimental to your well-being, or the well-being of your bloodlines, to whom does the "blame" correctly reside? If KARMA is a perfectly objective adjudicator of fact, where would the "blame" lie? Are you responsible for the outcome of your choices?<br><br> Note, as I have stated many times before(!) that there is ALWAYS an "escape" mechanism to any situation, no matter how "impossible" the situation seems! Note also that in some cases and situations, the advancement of one bloodline can be symbiotic and beneficial to the both. Although fair disclosure insists I inform you that ours has a long and distinguished history of taking the "lions share" in any such exchange!<br><br> Laughing out loud!<br><br> Sir or Madam, after 48 pages of posts (mostly nonsense) I must say that you, because of your "experience" or other bloodline developments, are on the cusp of new and exciting possibilities.

How would sheep be able to destroy your long term goals so easily? If the idea of your existence is just to continue on your blood line, why not work on just that, instead of controlling the mob, and indirectly leading them to their own destruction?<br><br> How can you justify such a large scale "end of the line", without any negative energy coming back to you/your bloodline? Do you plan on just sitting and watching as the destruction unfolds?<br><br> What about the non-sheep that will ultimately fall so that your blood shield survives? The ones who understand what sweat is... What work is... What "law" should/should NOT be. What love is.The ones who don't need/want money in order to survive, don't have credit cards, don't live off of the Government hand-outs. Have no use for fiat.<br><br> During your many brain-storming sessions on controlling sheep, did any one ever try to imagine a world where there was no fiat money? What were your reasons that this world would not work?<br><br> How do you personally use DMT? What if any, are the rituals that go along with DMT. Where do you "collect" your DMT from, or do you make it yourself?<br><br><br> There is one universal truth that I have learned as well.... the more positive the energy you put into something, the more positive the results will be.<br><br> Positive energy has no limits!<br></div><span class="c2">Quoting: <strong>Roz 852192</strong><a class="sm1 sm_text c1" href="/forum1/message1685421/reply29777261" rel="nofollow" title="Go to Quoted Post"></a></span></div><br><br> Hello Roz and Welcome!<br><br> Most of the questions you have posed were answered earlier in the thread. I must suppose that I have not been clear in some of the aspects presented.<br><br> I have posted a brief comment to Bluestar, a fellow poster here, on creating ones own reality. Please read and reflect on this!<br><br> Have you any idea how you have come to run the programs and subroutines you consider your "core beliefs"? The nobility of physical labor being a key delusional! Where did THAT one come from? As I understand, MOST humans eschew any form of physical labor and will offload manual tasks to others should circumstances permit. In America in 2010, for the first time, Americans spent MORE money on restaurant food than staple ingredients for home meal preparation! Personally, I avoid eating ANYTHING that the product and preparation is outside of my personal control!<br><br> You may be an exception to the heard...it's possible, but I am skeptical. Do you lead an aesthetic life? Do you grow your own vegetables and raise your own livestock? Do you barter for the essentials you yourself cannot produce? Do utilize fossil fuels obtained through military might and the subjugation of others?<br><br> Just asking.<br><br> Also, please note that it is ENTIRELY POSSIBLE to do those things...it just isn't observed!<br><br> As far as the "end-of-the-line" scenario, our hands are CLEAN. That seems to be the point you are missing. NATURAL LAW operates under the precepts and conditions of NATURAL LAW....NOT what you or others suppose it is...or bad information you may have received along the way! You need to understand the true nature of things to understand how to conduct your "business". It's just that simple!<br><br> Take an honest look at your life and choices, and seek to identify how YOU may exploit others to your (or your bloodlines) benefit. As the Bible admonishes, Don't worry about the fly ash in the eye of your neighbor when you have a post in your own eye.<br><br> Your question regarding DMT is an interesting one. Personally I do not utilize these substances, but NATURE makes them available. It is a different means to a similar end. The problem with DMT (and other) psychogenic releasing agents is the lack of perspective. One needs context and foundation! Humans who have taken these substances become aware that they have been living in a world of (self) delusion, but that's about the extent of their awakening. They then attempt to reconcile the two worlds...which is impossible.<br><br> Were a child, at its inception, brought into the true reality it would learn the "language" and customs of this true existence with openness and curiousity! There would be nothing to reconcile, so the understanding is closer to perfection. There would be no fear, because FEAR is not part of this DYNAMIC! See, you cannot envision a world free of fear because of your prior programming! Can you unlearn fear? If not, how do you function in an environment where fear is not known. Being unaware of the dimensions of fear, but seeing it as an energy source, would not humans "plug in" to this free energy source without repercussion?<br><br> No human thinks twice of collecting solar energy! If you found out with certainty that the sun was fueled by the burning and destruction of an entire civilization....that untold pain and suffering had been visited upon sentient life forms, would you turn away? Would you disassemble the solar arrays and hide underground, even though those in such a state had realized this condition based on THEIR choices?<br><br> Roz, one final comment. There truly is no positive or negative energy in the universal scheme of things.</div></div><div class="postWrap"><div class="postHead"><div class="postAuthor">Rothschild</div><div class="postDetails">User ID: 1339201 United States 02/24/2012 06:21 PM</div></div><div class="postMain"><div class="quoteo"><div class="quotei"><div class="quoteo"><div class="quotei">Think of all the so-called financial "experts" who pour over charts...<br></div><span class="c2">Quoting: <strong>Anonymous Coward 1339201</strong><a class="sm1 sm_text c1" href="/forum1/message1685421/reply29789024" rel="nofollow" title="Go to Quoted Post"></a></span></div><br> "Pore".<br> Also fait accompli not feit accompli.<br></div><span class="c2">Quoting: <strong>Anonymous Coward 433811</strong><a class="sm1 sm_text c1" href="/forum1/message1685421/reply29789134" rel="nofollow" title="Go to Quoted Post"></a></span></div><br><br> You are correct!<br><br> Thank You for caring!</div></div><div class="postWrap"><div class="postHead"><div class="postAuthor">Rothschild</div><div class="postDetails">User ID: 1339201 United States 02/24/2012 06:23 PM</div></div><div class="postMain"><div class="c3"></div><div class="quoteo"><div class="quotei">OP,<br><br> What is your blood type?<br><br> When did negative blood come into existence?

In regards to your subject the bloodlines as the most precious thing, made me think... Actually I have to admit that you are right.<br><br> I came from low-middle class (more likely low) family and we survived only by our integrity and strong commitment one to another. I remember from childhood, my both parents lost their jobs at the same time and there was none on the market at the time. You can imagine the situation (if you can) ... I was totally ashamed to tell friends ... as I didn't want to touch the subject how we provide for our surveyor. Even thou I was not worried for a second. The truth is that humans love to see someone less fortunate then them.<br><br> Even thou my parents are not "highly educated", are extremely smart. Modestly I admit I am even more (baby sister too). We can "feel" other people, what they think and what is their next move. Usually they feel pretty uncomfortable, .. you could imagine why. We have not many friends other than family. I guess they can't stand us for a long ... :)<br><br> Parents teach us how to deal with outside and we learned it perfectly. I am not sure, if it is genetic predisposition or whatsoever, ... you are expert on the topic.<br><br> To make long story short, me and my sister are well educated and not deluded that it is only a paper (the university was a joke). I am laughing out loud when people put so much stress on given title. I could shortly obtain whatever degree is needed! On the top we have "dream jobs", ... we don't care at all and pretending that we are so grateful for it, ...as there are so many people knocking on the office doors. Sure just go ahead, with brainless army ... and here we are!<br><br> Now that we enjoy milk and honey of the upper class, so to speak, ... but not interesting in wealth at all. I see hard times are knocking on our doors. I could give everything away and live on a street. I am ready at any moment. Do you catch my drift?<br><br> Oh god, everything is so stupid and you know what? You are exactly right, people are the worst enemy to themselves. It will ever end? Yep sure, look at the Maya stone wheel (calendar) is about to fall on new age preachers head.

If you are the male...YOU have the obligation, bestowed by nature! to form and forge your DESTINY...and that of your ancestors and progeny! Can you not see this clearly??<br><br> YOU alone will decide, or not decide, to be bold or timid...to dream or not to dream! To make new or live small! Gain or lose!

However, the attributes you used to describe him (selfish, somewhat evil and loyal) is most perplexing to me!<br><br> Selfish would generally be considered as predominantly interested in ones own interests and situation. Do you know anyone to whom this would not apply? Selfish is an emotional word, heavy with negative connotation, but describes perfectly "the way humans really are". Of course your father is "selfish"...what human isn't? Even the much beloved Mother Theresa was a fraud by this measure. Who could live up to such a standard?<br><br> "Somewhat evil"? Laughing out Loud!! Similar to "Somewhat pregnant"? I would be MOST interested in hearing your definition of "somewhat evil". Was there a specific act, or series of acts? Were they for "selfish" motives? To whom did the benefit of his "somewhat evil" acts accrue?<br><br> Of course, loyal, is the ultimate test. I assume you mean loyalty to his blood line...or was there some event or events you witnessed which led you to this conclusion?<br><br> You would do well to find out right away...or sooner...if you are Rh -. I have posted before on this very important topic and it completely baffles me that most humans do not know their blood type or if the Rh antigen is present in their blood! However, many humans can tell you about the events in other humans lives...celebrities for example. An Rh + mother can do fatal harm to her Rh - baby!!<br><br> I have drilled to those who would listen that nature, and natural law...CANNOT BE DENIED! Do you understand that?<br><br> Natural law! A mother's immune system attacking her own bloodline offspring?? How can that be, dear A/C...??? Isn't the maternal bond supreme in nature? Doesn't the mother act selflessly for the good of the child?? But yet there is this apparent "abomination" of nature in the reproductive process??<br><br> For the thick-headed among you, what does the immune system do in the human body? Repel invaders, you say?<br><br> How do viruses replicate in nature? By invading cells and injecting foreign DNA into the hosts cellular reproductive process you say?<br><br> And how does the host respond to this invasion you may ask? By attacking the pirated cell, you respond?<br><br> Is the mother's immune system, from the knowledge of the ages, responding to the foreign presence in her sacred space?? Do the maf!! And don't hesitate to Axe me a question!!<br><br> The Socratic method does not work if I have to do the questions AND answers people!<br><br> Laughing out loud!!<br><br> Poor, deluded sheep!<br><br> The fact that your father has had "deep conversations" with you is something you should embrace. If you feel your father is selfish, somewhat evil and loyal, it will be necessary for you to clearly understand the basis of these feelings. You will not be able to benefit from what he is trying to do for you if you harbour such ambivalent feelings for him.<br><br> I would strongly suggest that YOU carefully reflect how YOU would measure up to the standards you apply to your father. Perhaps you would like to explain YOUR life to me in that context! What are YOUR selfless acts? Have you committed any somewhat evil acts? Are you loyal?<br><br> Never forget, dear A/C, that you are "of his blood". How different can you really be?<br><br> "The killer in you is the killer in me"?<br><br> Laughing out loud!</div></div><div class="postWrap"><div class="postHead"><div class="postAuthor">Rothschild</div><div class="postDetails">User ID: 13751769 United States 04/18/2012 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="postMain"><div class="quoteo"><div class="quotei"><div class="quoteo"><div class="quotei">yes, I am of that evil banking clan, but a black sheep in wolf's clothes,<br><br> even if the stupid amoungst you want the truth, you are too uneducated to know what even to ask.<br><br> ask the right questions, get the right answers.<br><br> what say you, brain trust and learned of glp?<br></div><span class="c2">Quoting: <strong>Anonymous Coward 1339201</strong><a class="sm1 sm_text c1" href="/forum1/message1685421/pg1#op_post" rel="nofollow" title="Go to Quoted Post"></a></span></div><br><br> Can you do a few things for me:<br><br> #1 Fix medical Problems<br> #2 Give me about 20 million dollars<br> #3 Relocate me to West Coast (maybe California, Nevada)<br> #4 Get me a nice challenging job to keep busy and challenged<br> #5 Nice House over on West Coast.<br> #6 Nice women/babes to enjoy company and speak/deal with.<br><br> and that's about all I need.<br><br><br></div><span class="c2">Quoting: <strong>Future Viewer</strong><a class="sm1 sm_text c1" href="/forum1/message1685421/reply30696574" rel="nofollow" title="Go to Quoted Post"></a></span></div><br><br> Hello Future Viewer and Welcome!<br><br> Thank you for your "punch list"!

It is an absurd notion to them, and IS absurd on many levels! So who was the "winner" and "loser" in this transaction?<br><br> If you were playing by the settlers rules, they won.

There is much written that need not be summarized here, and nothing to be gained at basking in the glow of the successes! Consider that there have also been many, many "learning experiences"! THOSE are what we teach our young! BECAUSE! There is where the "value" is to be found. Perfection comes from focusing ones efforts upon experience and embracing them as the lessons taught by NATURE! So very valuable! Success is sweet rain! Soft rain, which falls upon our fields and prepares the earth for the next planting. Nothing more.

I have always dreamed of a world where there are no borders, no famine, no greed, no wars and no prejudices. A world where every human has the right to exist as a free spirit, to wander, explore and share the space we are given to educate ourselves and each other, to be friends with each other, and to essentially give more back to our society than we take.

The NATURAL WORLD and NATURAL LAW operate exactly in this way.<br><br> However, by your choices and actions, you have redefined your reality. Yes, you have this power, as all do.<br><br> Think of this simply. Let us presume that you, and three of your peers, are invited to play MONOPOLY, a popular board game.<br><br> Prior to your engagement, or consideration that this is even a possibility, a far away corporation had invested considerable effort and human resources to invent the rules, engineer the physical aspects (board, play pieces, dice, etc), manufacture said game, provide the channels of distribution, market the game such that you were aware of its "benefits", etc, etc. The corporation proposed that you would obtain enjoyment from this game in exchange for your consideration of a certain number of work units in exchange (federal reserve units in the US, for example). This also constitutes your "buy-in" of the whole process!<br><br> Continuing, the four of you sit down and form a social contract that you will all abide by the rules, and that each player will play a role in the process, as symbolized by the players choice of token.<br><br> One lucky player even gets to be the banker--Lucky Him or Her!<br><br> Laughing out loud!<br><br> Note that many are not qualified, or don't want the responsibility of being banker...usually due to poor education or organizational skills!<br><br> Laughing out loud!<br><br> The game is played out and a winner is determined! "Cheaters" are dealt with at the discretion of the group.<br><br> Now it gets interesting! Some enterprising players develop rule variants. The group has to agree, and sometimes purists object. The game can only proceed if all agree to the changes, and abide by the common rules. Over time, the corporation has adopted certain of these variants, and not others. Generally, it is the demand of the majority which prevails!<br><br> Is playing MONOPOLY the only option? No. You can choose to play RISK, MILLE BORNES, POKER or nothing at all! You can read a book, go outside, or rob a bank!<br><br> YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PLAY ANY PARTICULAR GAME! But if you do choose to play, social contracts, norms and peer pressure will force you to play to the rules!<br><br> A utopia existence is an option on this planet, and there are those who live such a life. Clearly, having a society of like minded humans will make this easier, as a division of labor is easier that going it alone. For this, you need to find like minded individuals!<br><br> Tell me UK, have you surrounded yourself with like minded individuals? Do you devote your energies to bringing your desire to fruition?

What I've always wanted is the freedom to live a life, a life given to me by mother nature herself.<br></div><span class="c2">Quoting: <strong>Anonymous Coward 1580790</strong><a class="sm1 sm_text c1" href="/forum1/message1685421/reply30770516" rel="nofollow" title="Go to Quoted Post"></a></span></div><br><br> Hello Mr. UK,<br><br> The MONOPOLY/Capitalist System is but one game, with arbitrary rules...and it is not required that you participate!<br><br> Someone once said "if you do what you did...you get what you got". Folksy, yes, but with an understated element of truth.<br><br> I rarely recommend anyone invest time in watching a video, but for you, MR UK, I believe it would be a prudent use of your time. The video is called THE PARKING LOT, a small independently produced venture which documents the adventures of a small, well educated group of parking lot attendants in the US. It contains many truths about the human condition and how humans, well educated and otherwise, respond to stimuli, boredom and reconciling what they "know" and what they experience in their daily existence. Humans seldom do well with mindless routines over time.<br><br> Are you, Mr UK, consumed in mindless routines?<br><br> Please understand that how you were conditioned is responsible for your choices and what you perceive as "winning and losing". You probably know the Buddhists believe that mastering control of the ego is essential to ones mental well being. That desire is the root of unhappiness. Also consider that your state of mental well being is DIRECTLY correlated to what you eat every day of your life. You can effect a MAJOR change in how you feel by being mindful of what you EAT. Food is indeed your medicine. Heed that well!<br><br> Many people incorrectly assume that vast resources means an "easy" life...easy in the sense that one has everything one "wants" (as opposed to what one needs)and lives a life free of worry. Nothing could be further from the truth.<br><br> I propose you need a reset of priorities and I would be happy to walk with you through the process. I believe you to be a man of value and worth.</div></div><div class="postWrap"><div class="postHead"><div class="postAuthor">Rothschild</div><div class="postDetails">User ID: 13751769 United States 04/23/2012 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="postMain"><div class="c3"></div><div class="quoteo"><div class="quotei"><div class="quoteo"><div class="quotei">The problem was that Tesla forgot to design in a METER!<br></div><span class="c2">Quoting: <strong>Anonymous Coward 13751769</strong><a class="sm1 sm_text c1" href="/forum1/message1685421/reply30770106" rel="nofollow" title="Go to Quoted Post"></a></span></div><br><br> So if I can figure out a way to design a way to METER Free Energy, the Rothschilds will be more accepting to its widespread implementation?<br></div><span class="c2">Quoting: <strong>Open Your Eyes</strong><a class="sm1 sm_text c1" href="/forum1/message1685421/reply30770188" rel="nofollow" title="Go to Quoted Post"></a></span></div><br><br> Zippy, Please TRY to comprehend what I am saying!<br><br> It isn't that TESLA couldn't figure out how to meter power!

And you have expressed yourself quite well in English!<br><br> Generally you are correct. I would add that the process is OBSERVATION, which leads to KNOWLEDGE, which leads to WISDOM. There is also the application of scientific principals, by which a hypothesis is formed and TESTED, to confirm that the observed phenomena is correctly understood. And don't forget, a LAW, by scientific definition is a fact set which cannot accommodate exceptions to the LAW. MOST IMPORTANT! If you have indeed discovered a NATURAL LAW, you will be unable to demonstrate a case where the LAW does not apply. If there is such a case, it is NOT a LAW.<br><br> The LAW of GRAVITY, for example. Very repeatable anywhere in the known world. No exceptions!Nor are there exceptions to NATURAL LAW.<br><br> From these basic precepts and standards the NATURAL LAW IS REVEALED...to those who take the time to understand.<br><br> NATURAL LAW, is endlessly complex in it's simplicity. TRUE BEAUTY INCARNATE. Of course, once the NATURAL LAWS are understood, they must be ADHERED to, or the consequences PAID.<br><br> To your question on JUSTICE. It is a human construct and has no NATURAL LAW counterpart....it is one of the major "BEAUTIFUL LIES".<br><br> Consider my earlier example of MONOPOLY, a popular board game. Imagine 4 children playing the game, all who have formed a social contract to abide by the rules. As the game progresses, one child is found to be cheating. The others are angry and the arguments escalate until one child hits the "cheater" who runs to mother for adjudication of the issue. While the three children cheated feel the punishment administered was fair, the mother would chide the child doing the hitting..."stop it, it's just a game". So both sides feel that their position was the just one, and whatever YOU choose to believe is similarly arbitrary. Arbitrary construct based on subjective belief systems.<br><br> NATURAL LAW would be neutral. If the cheater pulled it off, he would be rewarded with recognition and flattery for his gaming skills. If caught and punished, NATURE is satisfied as well. He did not have the skill set necessary to cheat and paid a price for his failure. The lad will "learn" to either not try cheating again, or hone his cheating skills so he would not be caught the next time. Feedback loop, and should the cheating skill set be enhanced, his bloodline would benefit!<br><br> Not to suggest that adults in societies positions of power; banking, politics, business media etc WOULD EVER CHEAT!<br><br> Oh my no!<br><br> Or perhaps those were the childhood type experiences which gave them the winning advantage as adults!<br><br> Laughing out Loud!!!<br><br> One other example.<br><br> Think of a rural Irish village in the earlier years when the Roman Catholic Church ruled the land with an iron fist.<br><br> Let us say that Sean, a local farmer who was known to imbibe to excess, failed to plant his potato crop one spring. Despite his wife pleading and begging, he spent his evenings at the pub and mornings asleep.<br><br> Fall comes and he has nothing to eat. As the snow falls, he becomes hungry and goes door to door begging for scraps to eat. The neighbors refuse to help! The church similarly closes their door to the hapless drunk.<br><br> Sean is found face down in a local ditch. The neighbors all say that he got his "just desserts" or the he got what was "coming to him". The parish priest lectured that Sunday of the evils of alcohol and the importance of thrift and industry.<br><br> Some might argue that Sean's treatment by his neighbors and church was unjust. But notice how each group uses the facts of the matter to further their own particular agenda, and that the agenda is couched in issues of morality, justice and virtues which are entirely created and maintained by humans, NONE of WHICH (except SURVIVAL) actually exist in NATURE.<br><br> In the NATURAL world, if one animal fails to prepare for harsh conditions, it dies. The others in the group are not affected whatsoever and move on after rooting out anything of value from their fallen comrade.<br><br> As to breaching the knowledge gap, there is no knowledge gap to breach. One knows or doesn't know. It may have taken TESLA 5 years to uncover a particular NATURAL LAW, but it would only take a week or month perhaps for him to teach another, if he were so inclined. One does not need to travel the same path for the discovery of each NATURAL LAW. Ideally, groups would work independently and share their discoveries for the advancement of the human race. However, as with the potato guy, one cannot expect another to do all the "work" and then expect a knowledge handout later after contributing NOTHING!<br><br> In terms of the posters who are critical of our accomplishments, and the sorry fellow saying he has no choices in why he finds himself unhappy!<br><br> Almost every human now has access to a computer and the internet...vast information and computing powers!<br><br> WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH SUCH POWER?

He doesn't know too much about everything else (no offense), but he did get that one bit right. Bickle, on the other hand, has no idea what he's talking about. It's funny you've used him for entertainment this long.<br><br> Anyway, your family is trained very well in the matters of the subconscious mind. You've become masters of it even, I can give you that. I mean, it is in your BLOOD, is it not? It was smart to create "new opportunities" for yourself(selves) at every cycle, but alas, this will bear no fruit. You have been misled your entire life, and have been indoctrinated with false knowledge. The ignorance doesn't help too much either.<br><br> Let's get down to it. What were you promised when reaching the source? I imagine that as smart as you are you would expect nothing less than freedom.<br><br> I regret to inform you that the "source" is not the true source. Instead, you will meet our master geneticist. And all he wants is our service, obedience, and worship. He will strike no deal with you. You will be promoted from guards of this prison, to wardens. That is all. The price of this will be your access to the subconscious, but I'm sure you will be complacent with your new found control, as you have been thus far. This, nevertheless, does not change the fact that you and the rest of your bloodline will remain in this prison.<br><br> Did you not know that he was the one who put as all in this prison? <em>Where do you think your blood comes from?</em><br><br> I hope you realize who you are dealing with now. You all have much greater chances than the rest of us because of what you've inherited - because of the actions of your central race! Source fears this because of the considerable possibilities of your escape. If you escape, the rest of us will as well eventually. For this reason, he has set you all up for extermination. You are all being gathered for your OWN harvesting as we speak and yet you think it is freedom you're being given!<br><br> So I am here to offer YOU assistance. Have you had any exposure to the genetic mind? It would be much easier to train a member of your bloodline. I have never come across one of you before. This must be done.

This falls under the general category of PHILOSOPHY, or SPIRITUAL belief set, and thus outside of my area of expertise.<br><br> I would say that from a hygiene aspect this cannot be beneficial for either party. Personally, I don't understand what all the commotion is about. From this "simple" act, a whole MOVEMENT has arisen, with the practitioners DEMANDING a set of RIGHTS associated with this primitive act!<br><br> I fail to see the connection between "buggering thy neighbor" and "social/contractual recognition" of the act. As with all things, FOLLOW THE MONEY is an appropriate starting point.<br><br> All I can positively state is that those who forsake heterosexual congress are guaranteeing the end of their bloodlines in most cases, and my position on THAT has been made clear. These people likely have some genetic "defect" recognized by nature which has activated some "end of bloodline life" programming subroutine. It may also be rooted in a desire to avoid the responsibilities and DUTIES which come with parenthood. Each bloodline has unique attributes and prevents a general categorization.<br><br> Needless to say, these RITUALS are of no interest or benefit to the bloodline, and are not practiced.</div></div><div class="postWrap"><div class="postHead"><div class="postAuthor">Rothschild</div><div class="postDetails">User ID: 13751769 United States 05/08/2012 11:21 AM</div></div><div class="postMain"><div class="c3"></div><div class="quoteo"><div class="quotei"><div class="quoteo"><div class="quotei">Bickle, on the other hand, has no idea what he's talking about.

This writer was unfortunately not versed in the way of Natural Law until reading this thread. So thank you for the priceless information. It has lent to some great insights and confirmed many privately held beliefs that have differed from the 'accepted norm' so to speak.<br><br> You are right to say that this forum is not a regular haunt for me. It is quite astounding where some people's beliefs lead them.<br><br> Alas, I must be honest and say that it was not a clever reference to the prussian philosopher. In fact I did just search to have find the reference you referred to but I wouldn't want to try and pretend I knew whom you meant.<br><br> A few people have asked for a recommended reading list. You've mentioned the DAS book already but if you would be so kind to suggest a few more then that would be all that this writer would ask.

For simplicity, I refer to these collectives as "Bloodlines"<br><br> 2) Generally speaking, and as per the operation of NATURAL LAW, each of these bloodlines, while sharing certain similarities, also have profoundly unique characteristics.<br><br> 3) Each of these bloodlines, currently manifest, have "evolved" (for lack of a better word, and used to convey understanding within the scope of your limited framework) under the stresses and formative pressures as per the operations of NATURAL LAW. Using your incorrect time-frame reference, you think of it as having "descended" from your bloodline elders..that you are the latest in a long line of similarly situated "likes".<br><br> 4) The fact that YOU and YOUR BLOODLINE are presently manifest, would SUGGEST that your BLOODLINE has, generally speaking, demonstrated something close to PARITY in its ability to adapt, as NATURAL LAW demands, with all other bloodlines presently MANIFEST.<br><br> 5) In the sense SURVIVAL might be seen as the OBJECTIVE, I would present for your consideration that the element of SURVIVAL is DIGITAL...on or off...one or zero. You have survived, or you haven't!<br><br> 6) Within the definition of SURVIVAL, humans have adopted the convention of RELATIVE COMFORT, Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and other such theories and philosophies (which, by the way, are based on commonalities of observation but FAIL to rise to the level of NATURAL LAW). RELATIVE COMFORT, in contrast, would be considered as ANALOG in nature. In that there are infinite points between the extremes of one or zero! Look at TESLA's A/C sine wave and then observe the numerous CYCLES observable in NATURE. SINE WAVE!<br><br> 7) Even the most thick-headed sot can grasp that RELATIVE COMFORT is less relevant that SURVIVAL. Presently, in the secure womb and comfort of your PARENTS BASEMENT, concerns of survival are not in the forefront of your mind! Per Maslow, you thus crave the creature comforts you associate with female companionship...and are not so dimwitted that you don't understand female companionship, in light of your numerous perceived DEFECTS, requires FIAT as a prerequisite to such companionship! You have been trained, and respond to FIAT like a salivating dog! "If only I had that ILLUSIVE FIAT" zippy thinks! Or does he?<br><br> Think, that is!<br><br> Laughing out Loud!<br><br> 8) As I have explained numerous times, and as most now understand, FIAT is illusory! Illusory! It only obtains "VALUE" when the subjugated masses consent (freely, by the way) to its use. Certain of OTHERS (to you) benefit by the use as a fraction of the total usage...that fraction having been determined in harmony with the LAWS OF NATURE!<br><br> Laughing out Loud!<br><br> Q.E.D.<br><br> In the most, and perhaps only, truly important category...which is DIGITAL! YOU are on parity with all other BLOODLINES presently MANIFESTING!<br><br> Although you are too dim-witted to do so, I nevertheless suggest you take a SKILL-SET INVENTORY to determine how you and your similarly dim-witted "ancestors" have managed to survive and adapt to the numerous changes which have transpired! Much as a POLITICIAN must maintain its political BASE, make sure and take care to hone your BLOODLINES particular SURVIVAL SKILL SET (s^3).<br><br> Your perception that you are a LOSER, while perhaps VALID in certain respects...perhaps ALL RESPECTS...should be carefully scrutinized by you. For example, what are the characteristics you so ADMIRE in other bloodlines? And from what traits springs this admiration?<br><br> From what I can decipher from your gibberish, you have a great desire and lust for FIAT!. Of the priceless gifts I have offered you (should you possess sufficient intelligence to warrant such a gift as demonstrated by your ability to ASK the correct question--which, sadly, you have FAILED to do). Concurrently, you understand on some level that FIAT does not exist and, thus, is a FRAUD in the most profound sense of the word.<br><br> You seek the keys to a KINGDOM which does not exist! All the time possessing your own KINGDOM which you are too blind to even see.<br><br> And, ironically, your blindness was self induced!<br><br> DOLT!<br><br> But let's continue on, shall we?<br><br> What have we deduced?<br><br> 1) In the traits which matter, you are on equal footing with other bloodlines<br> 2) You are seeking, chasing, a MIRAGE...thinking if you can only obtain that WHICH DOES NOT EXIST..that you can then begin your QUEST.<br> 3) Unbeknownst to you, your QUEST is well underway and you are QUESTING in your parents BASEMENT and investing your DROPS in unproductive ventures...creating imaginary windmills with which to tilt!<br> 4) Your PLAN A is to enlist the uncompensated and asymmetrical SUPPORT of a COMPETING BLOODLINE...your proposal is to have that bloodline disclose the knowledge they possess from timeless effort and using the guile and wit they, themselves, had developed within the SUPPORT OF NATURE!<br><br> TIME FOR A NEW MINDSET ZIPPY!<br><br> Here is what I propose to you (in addition to those suggestions already made!)<br><br> 1) Embrace the American (colloquial) expression:<br><br> IF YOU DO WHAT YOU DID...YOU GET WHAT YOU GOT<br><br> 2) Decide if you intend to end your bloodline. If so, HAVE A NICE DAY. If not, continue on to point #3.<br><br> 3) I suspect that you have little respect within your bloodline sphere. I suggest you do an honest assessment of where you are in that regard and begin by re-establishing your non existent credibility with an eye towards growing into a leadership role within your bloodline.<br><br> I suggest you take that inventory and begin by addressing your parents. DO they see you as a loser?<br><br> Perhaps a LETTER? Yes, a LETTER!<br><br> Dear Mom and Dad (you might begin)<br><br> First of all, I would like to express my thanks to you both for all the sacrifices, worry and effort you have invested in my rearing and upbringing. As I have matured, I can see more clearly that the responsibility of raising children is a difficult, and often thankless job. Too often I have taken you both for granted and for that, I am sorry.<br><br> The support you have afforded me has allowed me to reassess my life and to realize that I have much work to do personally to grow into the type of man I want to be. As a result, I have decided to do the following:<br><br> (perhaps list a few goals...education, new job, whatever you visualize your next best move to make)<br><br> (Add if you are fat)<br><br> You have likely noticed that I have gained weight during my tenure in your basement. Effective immediately, I am adopting a new eating regimen which will eliminate all meats and adopt a primarily raw vegan diet. Please be aware, that the time I have been inactive in your basement, I have in fact been researching many things and I now realize that my poor diet has negatively affected my ability to function. As I regain my vigor and life force, I will have the energy and drive I need to accomplish the above goals.<br><br> I am indebted to you both for your help. I would like to begin to repay this debt by doing the following tasks on a weekly basis:<br><br> (list some drudgery/duties you are presently shirking and making your elderly parents do while you sit and eat potato chips in the basement)<br><br> Further, as I obtain the ability to produce value from my labor or research, I will provide 10% of this income to you both to provide for your old age retirement, since Social Security is likely to be defunct. It will be my objective and stated goal to provide for your retirement and assure you both of the basic comforts in your "golden years".<br><br> As I demonstrate the ability to function in the adult world, I also intend to take a woman as my wife and carry on the ZIPPY bloodline. The courtship will likely not take place until AFTER I leave your basement, but it is on the "to do" list.<br><br> Thank you again for all of your help and support as I transition into adulthood!<br><br> LOVE<br><br> ZIPPY!<br><br> OK. So that puts together a structure, or blueprint if you will, for YOU and also lets OTHERS in your bloodline know what's up. It demonstrates you to be a MAN WITH A PLAN. It elicits the support of others within your BLOODLINE for their SUPPORT OF NATURE. All important items.<br><br> Of course, the above is only a SUGGESTION. You must modify to fit within the confines of your present REALITY. Your letter must be HEARTFELT and CREDIBLE...but also aggressive in SCOPE.<br><br> As you appear to lack writing skills, I would be happy to assist you in this regard, and also help you set reasonable goals. Other on here will likely have helpful suggestions!<br><br> I will walk with you, zippy, during your transition and assist where appropriate.<br><br><br><br><br><br> I would further suggest that you pay heed to these</div></div><div class="postWrap"><div class="postHead"><div class="postAuthor">Rothschild</div><div class="postDetails">User ID: 13751769 United States 05/11/2012 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="postMain"><div class="quoteo"><div class="quotei">ROF:<br><br> If I alone control my destiny and have at all times the power to manifest my will, what is the best way to access the kingdom within and breakthrough the confines of this illusory reality?<br><br><br> Thank you for your patience and guidance,<br> AROF<br></div><span class="c2">Quoting: <strong>AROF 5581632</strong><a class="sm1 sm_text c1" href="/forum1/message1685421/reply31111633" rel="nofollow" title="Go to Quoted Post"></a></span></div><br><br> Hello AROF and Welcome!<br><br> By realizing that you are confined by the illusions you, yourself, created!<br><br> I do not know your particular situation, but the ACQUISITION OF KNOWLEDGE flowing from the reality of NATURAL LAW is the correct starting point.

Your desire has been the norm for most.<br><br> Sadly, the molestation is by design, and part of a system of ongoing exploitation. Well, sadly for some anyway.<br><br> Others BENEFIT FROM SUCH ARRANGEMENTS!<br><br> Laughing out loud!<br><br> In the early American west, humans were allowed to fence in (stake a claim) for as much land as they could defend! Of course, other forces were at play, and others may have disputed either the concept or the terms. Many humans died defending their dirt!<br><br> The idea of registering ones land makes some sense if you buy into that system, and you perceive that system operates in a way beneficial to you and your interests.<br><br> Once that dynamic changes, you must ask yourself if the system continues to be one in which you are the BENEFICIAL PARTY!. For example, if registering the property (in the US anyway) subjects (those pesky words again, SUBJECTS!)...<br><br> Laughing out Loud!<br><br> ...you to PROPERTY TAXES where you pay rent to the licensing agency for the privilege of occupying what you thought was yours..and you have to pay a fee and REQUEST a PERMIT to make any changes...(!) what gives you the idea that YOU own the land?<br><br> LAND OWNERSHIP? How so? WHO OWNS WHAT?<br><br> SO, to your specific question, ALLODIAL TITLE isn't a check-box on some bureaucratic form, but more relevant to the experiences of the wild west!<br><br> For example, can you produce documents to perfect title from treaty? Do you know that treaty law is considered the supreme law in the US..in the sense that it trumps the constitutional laws as well.<br><br> If the property in question can trace the "hands of ownership" transfer back to the original treaty which relinquished true ownership from the original transaction, you have perfected title and no one can bother you from a MORAL STANDING. YOU ARE RIGHT!<br><br> Laughing out Loud!<br><br> Second part is more problematical! Can you defend your claim? Do you think those who benefit from your serf-dom will allow you to NOT be a serf WITHOUT A FIGHT?<br><br> Short AND long answer: NO<br><br> Ask the Native American Indians how that works out!<br><br> Of course, the NAI's were mostly drunken SOTS and TOSSERS and couldn't muster a decent squabble...legal or otherwise!<br><br> Then they were ALLOWED Casino franchises and have done NOTHING with that either!<br><br> See how the BLOOD always pays the PRICE?<br><br> Laughing out Loud!<br><br> The very bottom line, A/C, is you can have what you seek if you obtain the KNOWLEDGE 9freely available) and invest the energy and FIGHT to defend what is yours! SOme have prevailed along this line, but only sought limited authority over their land and STOPPED SHORT! And that alone cost them millions and almost a decade (in your timeline).<br><br> From cast experience, I know you will not do so...and YOUR BLOODLINE will pay a similar price as the NAI's!<br><br> Its COMING for YOU...Best get a BUMPER STICKER OR TWO!<br><br> Laughing out Loud!</div></div><div class="postWrap"><div class="postHead"><div class="postAuthor">Rothschild</div><div class="postDetails">User ID: 13751769 United States 05/14/2012 02:50 PM</div></div><div class="postMain"><div class="c3"></div><div class="quoteo"><div class="quotei">OP, just for the peanut gallery:::<br><br> What do you use for "money" in lieu of FIAT?<br><br> What is your first line of "alternative" medical action?<br></div><span class="c2">Quoting: <strong>Anonymous Coward 15722293</strong><a class="sm1 sm_text c1" href="/forum1/message1685421/reply31116751" rel="nofollow" title="Go to Quoted Post"></a></span></div><br><br> KNOWLEDGE.<br><br> The first line is, of course, to avoid situations where one would need MEDICAL ATTENTION.<br><br> The americans and their "health" systems!<br><br> HEALTH?

The landlord told the renter he was welcome to stay in the accommodations in exchange for a set amount of monthly toil.<br><br> The renter consented to the arrangement!<br><br> After a month, the landlord noted that the renter, upon exiting the flat, used a knife to slash the screen in the screen door instead of simply OPENING the screen door! In the evening, the renter would tape the screen closed with tape.<br><br> Although the landlord was angry, he was also curious why the renter went to so much trouble to slit and repair the screen rather than simply open the door! He decided to observe rather than confront!<br><br> Of course, over time, the screen was "opened" and "closed" so many times that it was completely shredded and useless for its intended purpose!<br><br> The renter registered a complaint to the landlord and DEMANDED he fix the DEFECTIVE DOOR!<br><br> If you were the landlord, how would you answer the tenants complaint?<br><br> Consider this as an allegory to DRINKING ALCOHOL!<br><br> The LIVER is essentially a SCREEN!<br><br> ALCOHOL, over time, destroys the liver/screen!<br><br> When the LIVER is DESTROYED, the HUMAN DIES A PAINFUL DEATH!<br><br> The HUMAN, learning his FATE, cries to the LANDLORD for a NEW SCREEN!

A quick look at the trends of obesity in western (and increasingly eastern) cultures makes this abundantly clear to even the dullest observer. One need only then consider the state of health care costs to understand humans are "killing themselves" from their "food" (phood) choices.<br><br> 2) Most are familiar with the admonitions of the "elders" that one IS as one EATS...and that ONES food ought to be ones MEDICINE. Ask if you need to be SHOWN the specific references!<br><br> Laughing out Loud!<br><br> 3) The optimal human diet is well understood and stated clearly in many venues...the christian bible being one. Refer to genesis, for example, which advises primarily a vegan diet (paraphrasing here a bit)....plants, seeds, fruits (in season and occasionally). Complete instructions can be found there for the inquisitive mind.<br><br> Incidentally, the observant will note the GREAT detail in which the bloodlines are addressed. Make of that what you might!<br><br> Laughing out Loud!<br><br> 4) Although there are differences between the +Rh and -Rh bloodlines, I am speaking here in general. One is best served health-wise with Ph alkaline blood. Animal fats and products tend to acidify the blood, whereas a vegan diet will improve alkalinity/Ph from a biophysical standpoint. Correct eating (vegan) thus makes the alkaline factors in the blood conducive to proper enzymatic reactions, hormonal balance and optimal immunological response factors.<br><br> 5) None of the above is "secret" information by any means. There are many commercial books on these topics and any human so inclined can adapt the correct diet any time one chooses!<br><br> Free will/free choice and all that!<br><br> The first thing most poisoned humans notice is the rush of energy from correct diet. With that energy comes radiant health and vitality. There have been videos on this blog showing women in their 70's who were lifelong vegans and they look like they are in their 20's! ANY human can experience this through their choices!<br><br> And consider also, that this is a BASE starting point! From this point additional, more esoteric discoveries have been made which BUILD on this simple TRUTH!<br><br> Again, this is a product of TRUTH and NATURAL LAW! In that ANYONE, even the sickly, can make these changes and obtain the same RESULTS!<br><br> NATURAL LAW! Learn it or PERISH!<br><br> Is this now abundantly clear?<br><br> Laughing out Loud!<br><br> Sleep is a very misunderstood process, much like TIME...which I have tried to explain to those here assembled...and with little success, unfortunately.<br><br> Sleep is MOSTLY a period of biological and psychological repair...generally from self-inflicted damages! It is not, strictly, necessary as a daily function in the sense of how most humans perceive it. If one understands time is not LINEAR, as I have explained, this becomes CLEAR!<br><br> If one adapts a vegan diet, less sleep is necessary because there is less damage to repair. If one lives in accord with NATURAL LAW, there is less stress...and again, less need for repair.<br><br> Another characteristic of SLEEP is similar to the state of meditation. This state can foster periods of mental creativity or relaxation. Unlike the repair state sleep which is MANDATORY, secondary sleep is generally, in a sense, optional...or perhaps more correctly, like taking a small holiday! Or astral travel!<br><br> Laughing out Loud!<br><br> From this perspective, I may answer your question!<br><br> I maintain strict dietary standards, produce all of my own foods and am in outstanding physical health!<br><br> My need for stage one sleep is minimal! Remember, that we have made some additional modifications...learned from NATURAL LAW...which again, are available to those who take the time to see and learn what NATURE teaches!<br><br> For those who have a feline, you have noted that they take "cat naps"...but even within this state can quickly "snap back" to full alert status! Cats roam at night! Cat nap during the day as they recline in the warm comfort of the sun! BLISS! This is closer to my REALITY!<br><br> Same goes for H2O. I have previously spoke at some length of the dichotomy of water, its critical importance to the human body and the work of some who have noted qualities of sentience...again hard for most to comprehend!<br><br> The water consumed by humans must be distilled, pure, and free of minerals. Simply stated, the human body can not assimilate inorganic minerals and solids of this nature. It Kills. Aside from the harsh chemicals and pollutants which spring forth from the TAP.<br><br> Minerals must be assimilated in their organic state, and that is only possible through PLANTS!<br><br> PLANTS ARE THE TRUE LIFE ALCHEMISTS!<br><br> Laughing out Loud!<br><br> Surely, Mr AC, you MUST have received this INFO by now! This is survival 101!<br><br> So, in summary, sleep nature springs from dietary choices and state of health! Distilled water is the single most important aspect of avoiding suffering!<br><br> Again, no SECRET SOCIETY STUFF HERE!<br><br> One would then question....if HUMANS can't even get the SIMPLE STUFF correct, what in the world would they do with more difficult concepts!<br><br> Further, even after LAYING THIS OUT clearly...such that any dolt or tosser could comprehend...not even 1 in 100,000 will undertake these changes!<br><br> What does that say about the state of your current condition? And whose "fault" is it then?<br><br> Laughing out Loud!<br><br> However, AC, you have asked questions of merit which is worthy of further support. Let me know if I can be of further service to you!</div></div><div class="postWrap"><div class="postHead"><div class="postAuthor">Rothschild</div><div class="postDetails">User ID: 7049345 United States 05/18/2012 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="postMain"><div class="quoteo"><div class="quotei">The next movement will be an asset credit system.<br><br> That is the majority of your assets will be turned into virtual credit so you can acquire things with it.<br><br> Deducting this credit will be by removal of an asset of a certain caliber.

Some of my questions still remain, but maybe i could answer them myself if I wasnt "trapped in linear time." If there is something I have already done, it is researching what has been written about time. If I were to have a discussion with someone irl about time, I would say to them time is not linear. It is something I can understand intelectually, but my experience of time is linear. By that I mean, the events in my life is happening one after the other. It appears to me as if there are many moments, all happening one after the other. I dont think any piece of knowledge will change that.<br><br> Anyway, onto the next questions. I like what you have read about psycedelic drugs. I am a fan of them. Have done pretty much all of them, but my favs. are shrooms, dmt and weed. You didnt mention weed. Idk if you would categorize weed as psy. at all, and when I think about it, a banker like you probably has never smoked weed hehe. Im very much in love with weed, idk if you have anything to say about it or not, just curious.<br><br> I read in one of your posts you were making fun of your nr.1 fan in this thread, Mr. Bickle, saying he was hearing voices. That made me laugh, as I myself, do hear voices. It started over a year ago, and it made me very delusional. They were very "spiritual" in their approch. If I was talking to you back then, Id say I was in telepathic communication with beings from another dimension. Thats what it felt like. I could write alot more about them and this experience, but short version, my parents saw there was something wrong with me, and I told them everything. They said I should seek help, and I spent the next 6months in a mental hospital. I was having deep conversations with gods, they were showing me things one can only experience.<br><br> For some reason, the whole thing gradually changed, and now its only 1 person left. Its a young girl, almost a baby. Im back to boring existence, but still hear this little baby girl now and then, when Im alone. Do you have any idea what this whole thing is about? Does a banker know anything about things like this? My doctor said it was because of all the psy. drugs Ive taken. If you say I have schizophrenia (thats ok, that what the doctor said), what the hell does that mean? Is it an unbalance in the brain chemestry? Is it pure audio hallucinations? Is there nothing to them what so ever? You see, they showed me and told me and communicated to me in ways no human can, its hard to just accept its nothing more than a sickness.<br></div><span class="c2">Quoting: <strong>Brekke 9644309</strong><a class="sm1 sm_text c1" href="/forum1/message1685421/reply31303087" rel="nofollow" title="Go to Quoted Post"></a></span></div><br><br> Hello Brekke and Welcome!<br><br> The qualities associated with THC are classified as psycho-spiritual in nature, and also have been demonstrated to have strong healing properties for certain illnesses.<br><br> Although the mechanism of healing is not commercially understood, it relates to a realignment of energy fields and the yin aspect counteracting negative psychic energies.<br><br> Many of the active components you listed are generally classified as DRUGS, although they have vastly different QUALITIES!

Some of my questions still remain, but maybe i could answer them myself if I wasnt "trapped in linear time." If there is something I have already done, it is researching what has been written about time. If I were to have a discussion with someone irl about time, I would say to them time is not linear. It is something I can understand intelectually, but my experience of time is linear. By that I mean, the events in my life is happening one after the other. It appears to me as if there are many moments, all happening one after the other. I dont think any piece of knowledge will change that.<br><br> Anyway, onto the next questions. I like what you have read about psycedelic drugs. I am a fan of them. Have done pretty much all of them, but my favs. are shrooms, dmt and weed. You didnt mention weed. Idk if you would categorize weed as psy. at all, and when I think about it, a banker like you probably has never smoked weed hehe. Im very much in love with weed, idk if you have anything to say about it or not, just curious.<br><br> I read in one of your posts you were making fun of your nr.1 fan in this thread, Mr. Bickle, saying he was hearing voices. That made me laugh, as I myself, do hear voices. It started over a year ago, and it made me very delusional. They were very "spiritual" in their approch. If I was talking to you back then, Id say I was in telepathic communication with beings from another dimension. Thats what it felt like. I could write alot more about them and this experience, but short version, my parents saw there was something wrong with me, and I told them everything. They said I should seek help, and I spent the next 6months in a mental hospital. I was having deep conversations with gods, they were showing me things one can only experience.<br><br> For some reason, the whole thing gradually changed, and now its only 1 person left. Its a young girl, almost a baby. Im back to boring existence, but still hear this little baby girl now and then, when Im alone. Do you have any idea what this whole thing is about? Does a banker know anything about things like this? My doctor said it was because of all the psy. drugs Ive taken. If you say I have schizophrenia (thats ok, that what the doctor said), what the hell does that mean? Is it an unbalance in the brain chemestry? Is it pure audio hallucinations? Is there nothing to them what so ever? You see, they showed me and told me and communicated to me in ways no human can, its hard to just accept its nothing more than a sickness.<br></div><span class="c2">Quoting: <strong>Brekke 9644309</strong><a class="sm1 sm_text c1" href="/forum1/message1685421/reply31303087" rel="nofollow" title="Go to Quoted Post"></a></span></div><br><br> Hello Brekke and Welcome!<br><br> The qualities associated with THC are classified as psycho-spiritual in nature, and also have been demonstrated to have strong healing properties for certain illnesses.<br><br> Although the mechanism of healing is not commercially understood, it relates to a realignment of energy fields and the yin aspect counteracting negative psychic energies.<br><br> Many of the active components you listed are generally classified as DRUGS, although they have vastly different QUALITIES!

It is, initially, quite surprising to see how many people have a negative view toward going vegetarian/vegan. I've been told by peers, who have tried this diet, to expect a drop in energy and to take multivitamins to compensate for the perceived lack of nutrition! However, I intend to stick to the new regime and look forward to any beneficial results. Especially so, in light of the latest revelations from you regarding the true 'nature' of meat consumption!! Although, I do hope what you have said isn't in reference to 'Thetans' in any way ha!<br><br> Distilled water is not as easy to organise without a more substantial Fiat investment. The solution to this obstacle is to channel the Fiat saved through going vegan towards the purchase of the requisite copper equipment.<br><br> I've read the Tesla book you previously recommended to me as well as looking at a lot of the information available online. His understanding of nature really is awe-inspiring. As you said, many of his greatest discoveries have not been implemented for mass consumption. It's self-evident that this suppression has suited those in power and that any change to the current status-quo would only come should it be considered to be advantageous to them (or should I say you). I've no doubt that you have thoroughly explored and surpassed Tesla's own research by now. What room does that leave anyone else to continue to pursue this field of research?<br><br> Regarding all that you have re-iterated about the non-linear nature of time, is something that takes quite some mental adjustment to accommodate and get used to! I have taken it to mean that, effectively, all an individual has is 'now'. You define yourself and will live with the results of what you are doing 'now'. 'If you do what you did, you'll get what you got' as you have said. There are no excuses, you must enforce the change in your own life RIGHT NOW to create the conditions that you (and your blood-line) wish to exist within. If I am not on track here I would greatly appreciate any further instruction you might have.<br><br><br> NOW, to address the hints you have been dropping as to the 'NEXT BIG THING': Fiat seems to be drying up amongst the general population. The rounds of 'Quantitative Easing' were SUPPOSED to pass Fiat to the banks so that they would then pass it on to small to medium sized businesses. That didn't happen as the banks are not willing to lend due to risk. Interest rates are at zero which eats up savings and punishes the financially prudent slave. You've told us that the middle classes will be a thing of the past. Unemployment rates are rising as businesses struggle to survive. This steers more people to be reliant on state benefits/social security as the weight of the worthless Fiat National Debt crushes all below it. In the UK, we are now seeing programs similar to those in the US, whereby those receiving unemployment benefits/social security are being asked to work full-time for corporations such as Tesco and Poundland. This equates to 40 hours per week for around £60 and quite significantly bypasses minimum wage laws. Good for an employer! Especially for an employer who looks jealously on at the low wages paid by his Chinese competitors!<br><br> I'll have to choose my words carefully here so as not to be written off as another dumb sot! If no value is to be attached to items, would that not indicate, no low-level public trade/commerce? A massive change from the current paradigm. During the last World War the citizens in the UK were given ration cards to provide for very basic basic food,clothing and heating needs. Might we see a technologically updated version of this applied due to the austerity measures? Food stamp usage in the US is enormous and ever increasing (like the average American waist line ha!) which would be in line with that supposition. You also mentioned that 'some will eat and some won't'. Might that be it? Will people have to do government assigned jobs to qualify for meagre sustenance rations? Or, will people be left to their own devices to survive or starve. To literally follow Natural Law by living like animals, surviving however they can in the wild. Will a 'Perception Changing Event' by an expedient to those ends?<br><br> You said that you will take your leave in October and that leads me to wonder just what will be going on from the 26th of that month. I wouldn't expect it to be good for the average person but on the other hand, you still offer hope that should your advice be heeded, then those with a strong survival instinct may have a chance. The irony regarding the events that have unfolded in Greece has not been lost. We may well expect the current deconstruction of western civilisation that has started in Greece to further be exported to the rest of us.<br><br> You have been gracious enough to encourage and enlighten readers here. The advice you gave that 'there is ALWAYS a solution to any seemingly intractable solution' gives me optimism. In fact you have said that it IS possible to cheat the fate that awaits most people. The majority of the populace has willingly walked into this 'Brave New World' but that does not apply to all of us. You mentioned the example of the turtles in a previous post which indicates the way you view us. So, although I am DEFINITELY grateful, I am also curious as to why you might want to offer any advice?<br><br> I'll not compromise in my resolve to eat and drink properly. I'll remain observant and do my utmost to live in accordance with Natural Law, free from 'beautiful lies'. In fact, I will continue to heed any advice that you may pass on. So, I can only say a BIG thank you for the time and effort you have afforded the readers of this thread!!<br></div><span class="c2">Quoting: <strong>Anonymous Coward 19103741</strong><a class="sm1 sm_text c1" href="/forum1/message1685421/reply32063833" rel="nofollow" title="Go to Quoted Post"></a></span></div><br><br> Hello Mr. UK and Welcome!<br><br> You have been very gracious in your presentation of questions and ideas and demonstrated respect by following through on suggestions made by doing further research!<br><br> I would like to expand on two points for your consideration.<br><br> Most in the west are familiar with the concept of YIN YANG...the interrelationship of seeming opposite forces. I encourage you to become familiar with this TRUTH and look for examples in your experiences. See if it rises to the level of a NATURAL LAW in your reality!<br><br> Let us start simply!<br><br> "Night" cannot exist without "Day".<br><br> "Truth" cannot exist without "Lies"<br><br><strong>"Problems" cannot exist without "solutions"</strong><br><br> One gives form, creation and life to another.<br><br> A straight line cannot exist in nature!<br><br> There is no timeline...there is no past and no future.

Keep this in mind.<br><br> Moving on to the concept of food!<br><br> You, presumably are an ANIMAL...a mammal.<br><br> You were a product of the insemination of egg by sperm. You were a live birth (again presumably) and a nursing mammal! Slow to mature and capable of complex cognitive interactions with your environment. Perhaps 300 million possible iterations of YOU, with one prevailing!<br><br> Sentient...capable of feeling pain, of growing and evolving.<br><br> What, of the attributes noted, differ from the animals you choose to eat? Say a PIG or COW...slaughtered by the hundreds of millions per year...and slaughtered without observing the laws and rituals of nature!<br><br> Most importantly, slaughtered on YOUR BEHALF!<br><br> It is well understood that these animals suffer greatly in their lifelong confinement (look up VEAL PRODUCTION for a "taste" of the sacrifice of YOUTH), are injected with all sorts of unnatural poisons and pharma effluents, fed genetically modified "grains" in a filthy environment.<br><br> Fear permeates their environment...misery unto DEATH.<br><br> Their complete existence is a MISERY from birth to death.<br><br> SLAUGHTER.<br><br> Where does all that fear and misery accumulate? Where does it go? Would YOU want to live in this existence? Do you APPROVE of these miseries being inflicted by those who act as your AGENT? Do you realize that AGENTS actions are lawfully binding upon the principal? As you BUY meat, you buy and legitimize this "system" of misery.<br><br> These mechanisms allow modification of thought perception which lead to such things as the aborting of human babies! Self-inflicted genocide! Astounding!<br><br> What will the next big advancement of humanity be?<br><br> Enquiring minds want to know!<br><br> Laughing out loud!<br><br> In the US, mcdonalds serves up billions of these little misery bombs...brightly wrapped and served by a grotesque clown character.<br><br> Eat up, Kiddies!<br><br> Eating animals is eating one's own. It is not a FOOD SOURCE per se, but cannibalism.<br><br> Consider another source of food. Plants.<br><br> Along the YIN YANG meridian, plants are opposite/complementary in most respects. Life forms, sure, and many realize now sentient.<br><br> However, plants and humans are symbiotic! One respirates Co2 and the other o2. One cannot live without the other!<br><br> Plants take non organic elements from the earth and make them digestible for humans. In fact, the only true source of minerals for human consumption come from plants. Elemental sources cannot be metabolized and end up causing sickness and death in humans.<br><br> Laughing out loud!<br><br> Human faeces is PLANT FERTILIZER! That which is SHAT is life giving food to plants!<br><br> Humans and plants have evolved together. There is much WISDOM which plants can impart to humans. One need only EAT!<br><br> Laughing out loud!<br><br> Let's create a small food chain scenario easily accomplished by MOST first world inhabitants.<br><br> You have, or acquire, a small plot of land. The land is fertile or reasonably so...or, worst case, can be rehabilitated with a small amount of knowledge of earthworms .<br><br> You plant a variety of green plants and vegetables...the type that humans normally consume. The cost of seeds is very small and through some miracle of life, you discover that the plants which grow also produce seeds...which can be kept for future growings! Food for now and the means of production for later!<br><br> You learn that by selecting the type of plants grown, you can make an ideal combination specific to your blood type and nutritional constitution. After some study, you learn that food can, indeed, be your "medicine"...just like that old guy said a few thousand years ago!<br><br> Laughing out loud!<br><br> After a period of systemic adjustment, you realize that your health has improved and you are bursting with abundant energy. You are never ill! No colds, no flu...no flesh eating bacteria!<br><br> The idea that one would need health insurance (socialist or private) becomes an absurdity!<br><br> At some point, you realize that the digestive tract you inherited required constant grazing...such as elephants, horses and cows do...and learn of JUICING! Most of the nutritional value can be extracted and made portable along with other benefits. You adopt this regimen after carefully weighing the pros and negatives and find an increase of super-charged energy....along with a small mountain of grindings from the juicing process...from vegetables and plants grown by yourself, with your labor...in your own garden!<br><br> You elect to form a relationship with a CHICKEN. Or maybe TWO CHICKENS!<br><br> You find that the chickens greedily eat the fibrous grinding remains along with bugs and anything else they can find...and, in exchange, give you a small nutrient bomb of proteins, high quality fats, organic minerals and other good stuff. They, in essence, extract the rest of the nutrition from the vegetables and produce it in a highly assimilatable form...complete amino acid profile, proportioned correctly.<br><br> Seeing an opportunity, you add this marvel of human nutrition to your green juicing! Raw!<br><br> Because the egg is UNFERTILIZED, there are no karmic issues with its consumption! Because you are providing a safe and healthy environment to the chicken; supplying it with healthy vegetables grown from the sweat of YOUR BROW...your toil...it is a perfectly symbiotic relationship!<br><br> Quid pro quo!<br><br> Now, the chicken ages and stops laying.<br><br> What do you do? WHAT DO YOU DO??<br><br> Why, you continue to care for the chicken...to feed it and respect it during its "life" as you did while it was producing eggs!

I asked my family for their insight, told them i want to create a farm and live self-reliant, they laughed at me.<br> "Will you produce EVERYTHING by yourself? You cannot live like that! Trust people(or corporations) a bit, there are regulations for food and for that and for this so they are safe etc.".<br> Although they have a point, it still breaks my will a bit.<br> Is growing one's food that easy? I mean i will have to work too, to acquire fiat(unfortunetly!) to buy things i can't produce, and that will probably require at least 8 hours a day(if im lucky!).<br> Will it be possible to do both in harmony?

Why? Because the student leads the teacher! In addition, one who actively seeks knowledge and wisdom...works for it...appreciates it...will ultimately be rewarded. Those given without effort do not appreciate or value that which was given...regardless of the value of the gift!<br><br> You have apparently been exposed to the university educational system and see it for what it is. The "best and brightest" which emerge from that process are generally immune to true discovery and the wonder of learning.<br><br> I travel in the far east extensively. The so-called PhD's there are typically myopic to an extent which is hard for westerners to fathom. Reason: Rote learning!<br><br> Not to say that the current educational system is useless. Learn the tools of communication, the language of the universe (math) and read great literature, if one can find it!<br><br> THEN, go forth and LEARN from the teachings of NATURE.<br><br> I tell you again, take control of your health via nutrition...live according to RIGHT PRECEPTS...and none can defeat you!<br><br> BUILD your eco-system, and draw nourishment from it. Treat the life forms within your eco-system according to their genetic pre-dispositions, and show RESPECT for this awe-inspiring TRUTH. You will be a man who controls his destiny, and it will MANIFEST in ways which others will be aware. This changes the dynamic of your relationships with others.<br><br> Following the thread of consciousness of nutrition, you may move on to higher states.<br><br> I already told you to drink only distilled water. Very important as your digestive system cannot process inorganic minerals. You will find disinformation regarding this topic, but do your research. All necessary nutrients comes from the plant cycle (albeit plants you grow yourself..not store processed). The miracle of water, the covalent bond...the perfect YIN YANG of hydrogen (builder/structure) mated with OXYGEN (an oxidizer...break down) is perfection itself. Water did not sign up to be a mineral transport...at least not for human needs.<br><br> YOU NEED PURE WATER...EVERY DAY.<br><br> I have previously referenced the works of Emoto...take that seriously. (1)<br><br> Read about FATS AND OILS...UDO ERASMUS. (2) Genius work! NOTE: AVOID ANIMAL FATS. Use HEMP OIL IF AVAILABLE<br><br> Secrets of the SOIL (3)<br> Secret Life of PLANTS (4).<br><br> Read these four books! Immediately.<br><br> You can also research the Alkaline diet. For informational/interest purposes, since you will already be following a PERFECT DIET by adopting my practices.<br><br> You have proven your sincere desire to evolve! This is but the first step in the process, but the critical one.<br><br> I will take you as far in the process as possible before I take my leave from this site. Report back to me when you have READ and UNDERSTOOD the above books.<br><br> Children of the Sun, Indeed.<br><br> You can also start looking into the work of HR Manek...previously referenced!<br><br> Selah!</div></div><div class="postWrap"><div class="postHead"><div class="postAuthor">Rothschild</div><div class="postDetails">User ID: 16040979 United States 07/10/2012 12:03 PM</div></div><div class="postMain"><div class="quoteo"><div class="quotei">I do not know if you are still answering questions, but I have a question and please indulge my stupidity.<br><br> I have read the greater part of this thread, to read it all I have neither the desire or the inclination.<br><br> I would ask you who? what is the "rofschild?"<br><br> All I know is that the rothchilds are a group of families that are supposedly in control of the planet and control the day to day lives of many people.

Those given without effort do not appreciate or value that which was given...regardless of the value of the gift!<br><br> You have apparently been exposed to the university educational system and see it for what it is. The "best and brightest" which emerge from that process are generally immune to true discovery and the wonder of learning.<br><br> I travel in the far east extensively. The so-called PhD's there are typically myopic to an extent which is hard for westerners to fathom. Reason: Rote learning!<br><br> Not to say that the current educational system is useless. Learn the tools of communication, the language of the universe (math) and read great literature, if one can find it!<br><br> THEN, go forth and LEARN from the teachings of NATURE.<br><br> I tell you again, take control of your health via nutrition...live according to RIGHT PRECEPTS...and none can defeat you!<br><br> BUILD your eco-system, and draw nourishment from it. Treat the life forms within your eco-system according to their genetic pre-dispositions, and show RESPECT for this awe-inspiring TRUTH.

This changes the dynamic of your relationships with others.<br><br> Following the thread of consciousness of nutrition, you may move on to higher states.<br><br> I already told you to drink only distilled water. Very important as your digestive system cannot process inorganic minerals. You will find disinformation regarding this topic, but do your research. All necessary nutrients comes from the plant cycle (albeit plants you grow yourself..not store processed). The miracle of water, the covalent bond...the perfect YIN YANG of hydrogen (builder/structure) mated with OXYGEN (an oxidizer...break down) is perfection itself. Water did not sign up to be a mineral transport...at least not for human needs.<br><br> YOU NEED PURE WATER...EVERY DAY.<br><br> I have previously referenced the works of Emoto...take that seriously.

Presumably to LEARN!<br><br> You take umbrage at my approach or methodology in communicating hard won and valuable TRUTHS...rather than embracing the opportunity to learn and evolve. Typical.<br><br> I read the religious screed you offered up for my "enlightenment", and found it quite telling:<br><br> 1) I have never aspired to "silence" naysayers! Do you know what a naysayer is?<br><br> noun<br> a person who habitually expresses negative or pessimistic views: <em>Despite a general feeling that things were going well, a few naysayers tried to cast gloom.</em><br><br> So, by definition a NAYSAYER is a PESSIMIST who, generally speaking, disregards TRUTH and CIRCUMSTANCES in favor of generating NEGATIVE ENERGY to others! Energy vampires, if you will!<br><br> I have no such interest in those humans! They have no capacity or desire to learn!<br><br> 2) I understand the CONCEPT of learning from ones students, but it is an absurdity on its face. The TEACHER offers experience and KNOWLEDGE the student lacks. Again, by definition. Using the Socratic methodology, the TEACHER learns the students deficiencies and tailors the lesson accordingly. If one were to engage a teacher who "learned" from the "student", I would posit the teacher is incompetent.<br><br> Similarly, if the student WERE able to teach the TEACHER, the student has been mislabeled! There have been a few examples of this throughout history, but few enough that I can safely disregard the likelihood of that being the case here!<br><br> PARTICULARLY since most of the posters are barely able to communicate a coherent thought, and lack the basic skills of spelling, correct grammar and syntax.<br><br> Seriously!<br><br> Moving on to the "meat" of your offering!<br><br> In general, the writing is RUBBISH!

You sir do not act for the good of the people or even for the bettering of our race when you compare everyone to children. You have been doing so for the first 10 pages and it is driving me nuts. If you are truly who you say you are (and I doubt it) then I believe you owe everyone in here an apology. Your Family « bloodline » and your « illusions » are killing people while you sit back without remorse. You said something about how China gets the hard work done and the U.S takes the benefits. Well in the same way you are a criminal getting rich off of the world and its flaws. You exploit them to get the power you want. You place very shady people that are criminals at the top of the power structures. You encourage human intolerance and you swiftly wipe your hands of any feeling. And you dare say that we are the ones that are trapped in our illusions. Be it trapped in illusions of one's self or be it illusions of godsend purpose, you are both. Now since I know that everything on the internet nowadays is kept and stored, for monitoring, I know that this message will probably reach the right people eventually. So better make it count.<br><br> How can you tell me that you are more evolved than I am, when you apparently make it possible for millions to go to war with each other? Consequences for your actions no matter what type of person you are will happen. The universe is of balance. And trust me (not threatening you in any way from my person) your bloodline will not continue pillaging and killing men and women everywhere by your tainted blood money be it an illusion or not. You spoke of illusions, but time is not an illusion. And your time will come for you too. Hoping it comes sooner rather than later.<br><br> In this world; money, is the power, that binds everything. By holding and gaining more of it; you are also part of this illusion. You are very much co-dependent on it as much as the « DRONES » you think the human race is. The only difference is: The scope. You will probably never see the day where everything is gone. Except if it is taken from you. And believe me, call it how you want, fate, and destiny, has a way of getting rid of people like you.<br> You are scared that the people are actually walking up to the real power structure of this world. A lot more people are now on to you.<br><br> Well let me tell you that no matter what technology you have to checkout time or possibilities, there is no absolute way of saying things will go exactly like planned. Chaos Theory remains. As this time line not only depends of every player within the confines of the « game » but also depends on every other iteration of every other possible combination in all other crossing realities. The numbers themselves could not predict any outcome to your advantage with such accuracy. And everything can change in a blink of an eye. All it takes is one Man, Woman, Child, Animal to go off the reservation, and I'm sorry no cigar!<br><br> How dare you call yourself enlightened when you plan global depopulation of the world? You rationalize murder and you plan genocide. There is nothing in there that shows me you are enlightened but only how very evil you are. Even telling me that there is no evil and there is no right. That is the biggest illusion of them all. What a better way to convince anyone to follow you... I bet it works on most people now doesn't it? You look at us from above, but I am also looking back at you.<br><br> I am taking a « wild guess » here but I believe that you are either a maniacal man (or woman but considering how you blasted the « triggers » of the female …… I would say man) or someone in deep need of redemption. This is probably the reason you are here on a subconscious level. Unless you have mutated into another species, the rationalities of the human race still applies no matter how hard you try and fight your ugly and unwanted « emotions ».<br><br> You probably tried burying them with logic or rational thought. But nature is weird in the way that total control does not exist. Even with your higher rationale, you are subject to the same physical and emotional needs. Do not dare tell me you are bigger because you are stronger. The only one you are impressing is you and your ego. And no matter how many people you will have reasoned or threatened, you will always have to face someone else and someone else. It can eventually get exhausting. I am guessing this whole getting rid of people thing is a secondary effect of the ego needing to mesure up to ones own self. Feeling like the "KING" of the "WOLFS" once the slaugher has happened.<br><br> And while we are on the subject, you also tasted a lot of pain in your life. This is why you subject others to this same way. This is why we are puny and you are big. To overcome the balance that was lost, in your childhood not having had the love and trust that you needed. I bet you are something of a romantic hidden within yourself. All the caracter traits of a very BALANCED human being.<br><br> Since this is Godlike productions and anyone could come in here and claim that he is a « ROFSCHILD » and « AXE me anything » I do not take you seriously. But admire your way of responding to everything in a very efficient and well written way. I would have to say that there is some part of me that believes this is you even if you spelled your family name wrong (and please don't tell me your doing this to be under the radar cause if you are who you say you are, then this visit is well known to your group, family, whatever)<br><br> So if you are who you say you are, and I do not say this lightly:<br><br> You should be sent to prison for the crimes your « bloodline » has committed over the last few centuries. It should also become the same of everyone who participated in this « Genius » Cover-up, so that humanity can once again, advance to the next stage of its evolution. Away from all the greed and pity you have caused us to feel, away from the expert manipulations and control freaks you are. Away from the rape and destruction of millions of families by men who had their hearts coerced by the stinking fiat currency you made available. You took away the freedoms of your fellow men, and you will feel the pain of it; as life fights back, to put you in your righteous place.<br><br> I am warning you, (and I know that this message will eventually get to those concerned) Do not treat humanity as a spoiled child, because you will find out that it has a hard bite. And even within the confines of 500 millions still remaining, when the truth is out there for most to see, and the mainstream media slowly losing its power to distort…. All you will be left with is a barren waste land, and a very angry mob. No money or « illusion » can save you from that. And even with all your intelligence and resources, people can always spot a liar after a bit of time.<br><br> Best of luck……<br> (I didnt even bother hiding my nick since its findable anyhow)<br></div><span class="c2">Quoting: <strong>MarMoTT 688079</strong><a class="sm1 sm_text c1" href="/forum1/message1685421/reply32302386" rel="nofollow" title="Go to Quoted Post"></a></span></div><br><br> So, you spent half an hour typing a fervent monologue to somebody who is either a fake psychopath or a real psychopath...?<br><br> You are a perfect illustration of why/how humanity has allowed itself to become enslaved and why/how it will continue.<br><br> I wish that all of you people posting in this thread could be rational, thoughtful and laconic.

Let's start with the first one first which will serve to also answer some others.<br><br> You comment on your addictions to media distractions, and have correctly noted that your progeny have the same predilections. I would assume that you have made the connection between these two facts!<br><br> Think of how the very young learn languages from their parents. Mimicking the sound pattern and watching the actions and reactions from word patterns, facial expressions and tone. Dogs are trained the same way of course.<br><br> Children have a functioning command of language before general structured education begins. Of course, in general, what is taught is a REINFORCEMENT of what the young have already learned. The same takes place in social mores and expectations as well. The parents are PROGRAMMED to teach their young certain patterns of belief and society, through religion and media REINFORCE these mental constructs.<br><br> Harvard did a 30 year study tracking the progeny of various segments of society to confirm or refute the "beautiful lie" of the american dream...wherein it is held that anyone can aspire and rise to any level of society. While there are notible standouts to every finding, statistically, young humans generally track their parents in the major socioeconomic indicators to a highly statistically significant level. In other words, no-one is going anywhere, but the DREAM of things being otherwise is most useful!<br><br> Laughing out Loud!<br><br> YOU, sir, will teach your young to be useful idiots...working slaves and serfs! Thanks for that!<br><br> Do you know, sir, that the percentage of serfs signing 30 year mortgages who actually READ the document is statistically ZERO? Even the most educated amounst you do not read a document which will consume over 30% of your working life income? Amazing to most!<br><br> I assume the above will answer your question(s) relating to children and the education of them. YOU alone, will set their trajectory and define their life. Choose wisely!<br><br> Memories are accumulated experiences, without the timeline component most assign. You survive because you ALREADY access these data, although you may be unaware. Think of all the functions the subconscious manages without your conscious thoughts (respiration, muscle movement, heart beat, etc). Subconscious also regulates your stored experiences and DNA history. Sad that the subconscious is an ALIEN aspect of your being!<br><br> Laughing out Loud!<br><br> You are genetically predisposed to survive NOW, and you do that very well. For those still predisposed to linear time, research the work of Dr Otto Warburg and the cellular research he completed in the 1930's. He demonstrated that the cells live indefinately until the local environment becomes fouled! Imagine that! One lives until they drown in their own filth! Curoiusly, his work was done on CHICKEN cells...Laughing out Loud!<br><br> Most true and EASY to understand!<br><br> Note that I have already provided the receipe for immortality, freely and without obvious gain. Note also that this GIFT was generally met with scorn, derision and disbelief! What many would consider the most precious of gifts...swept aside and largely ignored!<br><br> While I am not at all surprised, it is baffling how stupid humans have allowed themselves to become.<br><br> As to the balance of your questions, they have already been addressed or are inane and not worthy of my attention.</div></div><div class="postWrap"><div class="postHead"><div class="postAuthor">Rothschild</div><div class="postDetails">User ID: 13751769 United States 08/06/2012 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="postMain"><div class="quoteo"><div class="quotei">Greetings op, I have just finished processing the entirety of this thread and must say your direction is much appreciated though I reserve my right to judge veracity at a later date.<br><br> I have enjoyed making mental notes as I read through the nearly 100 pages of this journey and now bring them to bare for your thoughtful consideration.<br><br> If you feed off of your goyem and harvest their energy, and if I am to assume that the culling process you mention is thinning this heard, what is the shift in paradigm that must occur whereby you no longer need to feed on the goyem?

I have a adopted the vegetarian diet and also take a quality flax-seed oil supplement daily. So, I am happy to pass on the pleasing results of your advice!<br><br> First of all, I do feel noticeably healthier in body and mind. After sleep I wake up feeling replenished. Previously I might have gotten out of bed each morning feeling somewhat groggy, whereas now I arise feeling alert, charged and ready! I have also taken on board the ideas presented by Hira Ratan Manek and I try to take in the sun's energy as soon as I rise. I really like his advice about going barefoot to connect with the earth. Sunrise yoga is the ideal way to stretch out and start the day.<br><br> The book that has struck me the most is 'The Secret Life of Plants'. I am reading and re-reading it as I go along to fully take on board the ideas that are presented, as to say the implications of this study are profound would be an understatement. I won't go into detail here as it is up to each individual to come to their own conclusions but needless to say I am looking forward to properly analysing the other books by Tompkins &amp; Bird.<br><br> What is evident through researching the books you advised is that you have outlined a path towards enlightenment. In fact, I've just read the post where you explain that you have effectively provided the recipe to immortality. To any readers of this thread I would advise you to just give it a try for yourselves. I have taken the first tentative steps on this path and I do feel noticeably better. My mental acuity feels sharper and I'm enjoying this journey of discovery immensely.<br><br> Reading your posts has been both humbling and empowering at the same time and personally I look forward to each one. I have already praised your personal accomplishment and that of your family but...just...WOW!! STAGGERING!!

I have a adopted the vegetarian diet and also take a quality flax-seed oil supplement daily. So, I am happy to pass on the pleasing results of your advice!<br><br> First of all, I do feel noticeably healthier in body and mind. After sleep I wake up feeling replenished. Previously I might have gotten out of bed each morning feeling somewhat groggy, whereas now I arise feeling alert, charged and ready! I have also taken on board the ideas presented by Hira Ratan Manek and I try to take in the sun's energy as soon as I rise. I really like his advice about going barefoot to connect with the earth. Sunrise yoga is the ideal way to stretch out and start the day.<br><br> The book that has struck me the most is 'The Secret Life of Plants'. I am reading and re-reading it as I go along to fully take on board the ideas that are presented, as to say the implications of this study are profound would be an understatement. I won't go into detail here as it is up to each individual to come to their own conclusions but needless to say I am looking forward to properly analysing the other books by Tompkins &amp; Bird.<br><br> What is evident through researching the books you advised is that you have outlined a path towards enlightenment. In fact, I've just read the post where you explain that you have effectively provided the recipe to immortality. To any readers of this thread I would advise you to just give it a try for yourselves. I have taken the first tentative steps on this path and I do feel noticeably better. My mental acuity feels sharper and I'm enjoying this journey of discovery immensely.<br><br> Reading your posts has been both humbling and empowering at the same time and personally I look forward to each one. I have already praised your personal accomplishment and that of your family but...just...WOW!! STAGGERING!! No doubt you have only given us a glimpse of the tip of the iceberg as to what you know but I also have no doubt you are fully deserving of your place. And, of course, in accordance with Natural Law it could be no other way.<br><br> So thank you for this priceless help!<br><br> p.s the 'hello cretin' greeting to miss egypt was hilarious!<br></div><span class="c2">Quoting: <strong>Anonymous Coward 21409316</strong><a class="sm1 sm_text c1" href="/forum1/message1685421/reply32661675" rel="nofollow" title="Go to Quoted Post"></a></span></div><br><br> Hello Mr UK and Welcome!<br><br> Keep in mind that, in your linear time perception, it will require 6 months to two years to receive the full benefits you are just now starting to realize. Each and every cell in your body will regenerate over the two year period and you will be "re-birthed" as a new human, in line with the original objectives given freely to you, and others so willing.<br><br> Your blood will be completely rejuvenated and your life trajectory altered in a most positive sense. You will not know sickness, depression or sadness. You will be prepared for any impediments which may come your way and see, as we do, that these are LEARNING EXPERIENCES which greatly benefit YOU and your PROGENY. You will ultimately gravitate to other like minded humans and find a suitable mate who shares your philosophy of life. Your family will be healthy and strong as those OTHERS will fall by the wayside. You will see this for yourself!<br><br> The truly amazing thing is that you need not search for ENLIGHTENMENT...it will find YOU! Be diligent in your studies! Devote the majority of your waking hours to study as it will pay you back one-million-fold! Do not engage in drudgery and do not accept "work" which does not fulfill your mind and spirit!<br><br> Note that the plant book was written in the 1980's. Would you not expect that such research would be taught in every so called institution of higher learning? Note also that you have seen, for yourself, the POWER which RIGHT LIVING imparts. Despite your PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE, one of your "peers" has already tried to cast doubts upon what you yourself have learned. Try to explain why a human would try to dissuade you from helping yourself instead of learning the WAY and benefiting themselves? DO not grow angry at those who choose to ignore WISDOM and realize that they, themselves, choose to remain enslaved. FREE WILL affords them this RIGHT!<br><br> Between now and when I take my leave in October, I will gift you with other works which will complement your new reality. You have demonstrated that you are worthy of such knowledge. I will further state that should you continue on your path after such time, you will not walk alone. I will be most pleased to mentor you beyond my departure from this forum.<br><br> What fools these mortals be, indeed!<br><br> Laughing out Loud!</div></div><div class="postWrap"><div class="postHead"><div class="postAuthor">Rothschild</div><div class="postDetails">User ID: 13751769 United States 08/08/2012 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="postMain"><div class="quoteo"><div class="quotei">Poor sheeple,<br><br> I have some advice to alleviate your radiation doom jitters.<br><br> Number one, all of the Rofschild's food is grown for them in enormous, glass greenhouses by oompa-loompas.<br><br> Thus, they are not subject to fallout - or bad weather ;P.

It is clear to me that sex is a most powerful tool of control. Looking at how its use has progressed over time is most enlightening. A new paradigm is introduced at the top, in Hollywood or the entertainment industry in general. This is usually a shock to people, but it becomes intriguing in its own right. Then it flows down to everyone else and finally to people on the streets, children, et cetera, until it is the norm. Controlled rebellion is powerful, is it not?<br><br> So I see girls wearing less and less and thinking its fine. People in underwear on billboards, breasts being shown on regular TV (not that I watch it), STD's in young school children, and generally moral depravity. This is not an accident.<br><br> The purpose of sexual relations? Curious, do you mean the engineered purpose/significance or the pure one? Sex should be for spiritual bonding and for procreation. Without self control and with a healthy dose of well designed influence, sex becomes a tool of control, self destruction, guilt, and spiritual paralyzation.<br><br> I wonder if these alien entities have some stake in this, surely they do.<br></div><span class="c2">Quoting: <strong>Trois et mon droit 13802755</strong><a class="sm1 sm_text c1" href="/forum1/message1685421/reply32847235" rel="nofollow" title="Go to Quoted Post"></a></span></div><br><br> Hello TEMD and Welcome!<br><br> The topic will be fully explored prior to my departure.<br><br> It is the BIG PICTURE of sexual relationships which should be of interest to you.

Your search has been reduced to this thread...down from the internet!<br><br> Laughing out Loud!<br><br> You will benefit in all aspects of your life by applying some diligence to your endeavours!<br><br> Regarding your NEW questions:<br><br> Your choice of the word "purchase" is an interesting one. Based on this word, you will always be able to "purchase" land. If you wish to OWN land, in the historical sense and is traditionally understood, it is already much too late.<br><br> The COLLEGE process is but a form of bondage or slavery befalling the middle class progeny. Either the family, or the offspring, incur enormous expenses for dubious benefits. Note that almost all graduates from University still are woefully ignorant of financial issues, know how to read a contract...etc...etc. The importance of the STUDENT DEBT as a tool of enslavement cannot be overstated. Savvy observers have already noted that STUDENT DEBT cannot be extinguished through the bankruptcy process...curious WHY that would be? Take the advice of a wise man who once admonished others to "follow the money". In this case, Goldman Sachs will be one of the firms found at the trails end. STUDENT DEBT is a huge expense, a huge profit for some and literally KILLING the middle class once and for all.<br><br> If one wishes to be educated, there are myriad ways to accomplish the acquisition of a REAL education. For those too stupid to see through the educational sham, it is their choice and their fault. None others...and the juice from this particular fruit will be VERY bitter for those who choose to partake.<br><br> The Income Tax "system" is an intellectual construct designed to obfuscate and confuse...and it has been wildly successful. It is one of the main reaping/harvesting devices.<br><br> In order to understand the system of confiscation, you must have a cursory understanding of contract law, which is remarkably easy to obtain if one is willing to turn off the idiot tube and apply ones self to the acquisition of knowledge. Doubtful.<br><br> Second is the understanding of the fact that words mean things. Further, words are empty vessels to which meaning can be filled. Under contract law, words carry the meaning that the contract drafters assign. Read a REAL contract and you will see that, after the recitals, generally come definitions. What are definitions, you ask? Whatever the contract drafter SAYS they are.<br><br> Example, you are writing a contract that says "The word GREEN, for purposes of this agreement, shall be held to mean RED", as defined by a standard Pantone color chart. You sign this contract in order to obtain a drivers license, and have therefore accepted this meaning of the word green. Chances are that you did NOT read the contract, but merely signed the form that the drivers license official stuck in front of you and told you to sign. SHEEP!<br><br> Laughing out Loud!<br><br> You are subsequently ticketed by a corporate armed militia employee and charged with running a green light. You go to the local court and become tongue tied trying to unravel a Gordian know of nonsense.<br><br> Good luck with that one.<br><br> There are ALWAYS ways to avoid the trap. I have already explained this in great detail, and most of your other questions as well. Why do you not take the time to READ AND LEARN?<br><br> Your question about men forcing women is STUPID to the extreme! A woman will follow a man if he is deemed worthy of following. Are you worthy of following? DO you have requisite skills? Are you a good provider? Can you provide a safe environment? Do you demonstrate courage and leadership under fire?<br><br> Certainly not. Most relationships in the first world countries are not based on these traits, and thus do not survive the onslaught which comes later.<br><br> Seemingly you do not grasp the basics, and are not in a state of readiness to learn important information.

Preferably an isolated cabin in the woods, far from civilization.<br><br> Note: If you are not prepared to do this correctly, don't bother attempting as there will be no benefit or learning.<br><br> Now, take only the bare necessities with you to sustain your life. If you are smart, and I think you are not, you will take a vegetarian, minimally processed diet. Plan on a morning and evening sungazing and use only purified/distilled water. In this phase, you may take whatever READING materials you desire, but absolutely no electronics. It is also best if your refuge does not have electrical service.<br><br> Spend three whole days reading and resting.<br><br> Return to your normal grind.<br><br> Phase two.

Another commonly heard phrase is "live by the sword, die by the sword"...one will not die the death of a swordsman if one is NOT of that profession. Not to say a non-swordsman cannot die by the sword...simply that it is NOT a swordsman, but rather a civilian, doing the dying.<br><br> Why is that relevant? Because EVERYTHING is relevant. Ignore nothing...assume nothing! THAT, cretins, is as fine a starting point as any.<br><br> ASSUME NOTHING...check EVERYTHING!<br><br> NOW, dimwitty, let's look at a few things here.<br><br> I advised you, and others, to learn the basics of contract law....rooted in common law, and used as the basis of most western legal systems.<br><br> Contracts can attach in more than one way. Go and study on this and report back to me so that I see your questioning is sincere and you are not just another lazy "seeker" of the sort who have fouled this work to date.<br><br> Once you understand the various points of contractual engagement, THEN you can begin to ask the correct questions...<br><br> 1) From where does the taxation authority used to enforce my subjugation flow? Look up subjugation if you do not understand this term.<br><br> 2) What are the terms of contract law which are being applied in the relationship between "me" and the taxing authority. Again, back to contract law...offer/consideration/performance etc.<br><br> 3) What do I give and what do I get?<br><br> 4) Who are the parties to the transaction?<br><br> 5) How may one or the other terminate the agreement, by, say breach, non-performance or voluntarily?<br><br> 6) In the event of contract termination, what are the remedies available to the breached party.<br><br> Now, some basic questions. By what authority do you CLAIM to own the property in question?<br><br> By what authority BACKS UP this claim? In other words, if some real or artificial person made CLAIM that they, in fact, owned the property...how would that claim be adjudicated? Would YOU accept the results of the arbitration?<br><br> What would your recourse be if the decision rendered was one you did not agree with?<br><br> Property ownership is a primitive concept...rooted in history, but not a universal one. Native Americans conceptually lacked understanding of property ownership that Europeans and Americans take for granted. However, if an intruder were to encroach on the space which they occupied at any particular point, they would likely fight to the death, would they not? They would not, however, define the land as theirs, as that was absurd to them on its face.<br><br> They didn't own the land, but on the land which they chose to occupy, they would fight to the death to defend it.<br><br> Those Native Americans had a more evolved understanding of property rights than westerners. One does not truly own land, but one DOES control what land one can, while one can.<br><br> A young man might, in this scenario, stake a claim on a small patch of land somewhere and not allow others to pass. If the young man were able to ENFORCE his claim, he would indeed control that parcel. Does he own it? In a sense it is supposed. He can do with it as he chooses.<br><br> As an old man, others may challenge his ownership. If he prevails, he continues ownership...if not, ownership/control passes to the other.<br><br> This example is the sense of ownership in its pure form.<br><br> Of course, groups of humans may band together and set rules with various and sundry methods of registration and dispute resolution based on the common good....<br><br> Of course, such systems may be completely infiltrated and corrupted beyond the most wild imaginations limits, but that is another story for another time...<br><br> Laughing out Loud!<br><br> Anyway, by what methodology do you claim the authority that you are the owner of the land?<br><br> If this methodology is administered by some other authority, have you granted this authority to act in the interests of the greater whole? Or does the taxing authority have any specific duties to represent YOUR interests? If so or not, what are the limits and operational rules?<br><br> See...again, how does one think they have RIGHTS when they submit to an authority structure to which they have no basic understanding of the rules of engagement?<br><br> Stupid!<br><br> Unless you do some work to learn the rules under which you operate, you will be serfs FOREVER! And I can guarantee this will be the outcome for your LOT.<br><br> Stupid cretins!<br><br> OK. There will be no intelligent signs of life so no point continuing.<br><br> Just for amusement purposes, ONE of you show some initiative and send your local land taxing authority a letter of inquiry. Ask them some iteration of the following:<br><br> 1) By what authority do you levy a tax against my property?<br> 2) Do you, as a taxing authority assert any claim of ownership, lien, attachment, encumbrance or otherwise, against the parcel in question<br> 3) Has the parcel in question been pledged as collateral, generally or specifically, in any capacity whatsoever against any debt or obligation of a governmental agency or private entity?<br> 4) Is there any claim recorded against this property, and are there any arrears or payments due to release any prior claims in order for clear title.<br> 5) What is the procedure and amount necessary to obtain allodial title for the property in question<br> 6) What is the procedure to have the property in question removed from the tax roles?<br><br> General questions:<br><br> 1) By what methodology is the tax applied to assure an impartial apportionment of the tax burden.<br> 2) If property valuation is the operational methodology, why is an objective measure, such as square meter not used instead.<br> 3) How many parcels are defined in the area of the taxing authority.<br> 4) What is the total area of the taxing authority, and of this area, how many are taxable parcels.<br> 5) Of the untaxed parcels and land, list each and every reason why these properties are not taxed.<br> 6) How many properties have received tax exemptions, and what is the lawful basis of exemption?<br><br> etc etc.<br><br> Start doing research and start asking questions. It would be fitting if a few of you figured out the property tax fraud, since it is the basis of all the other frauds as well.</div></div><div class="postWrap"><div class="postHead"><div class="postAuthor">Rothschild</div><div class="postDetails">User ID: 5806149 United States 10/15/2012 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="postMain"><div class="quoteo"><div class="quotei">Zippy in 13 years<br><br> :leader1:<br></div><span class="c2">Quoting: <strong>Open Your Eyes</strong><a class="sm1 sm_text c1" href="/forum1/message1685421/reply33888563" rel="nofollow" title="Go to Quoted Post"></a></span></div><br><br> Zippy Now<br><br> [ <a href="http://www.google.com/imgres?q=images+gangnam&hl=en&sa=X&biw=1920&bih=1137&tbm=isch&prmd=imvnsu&tbnid=IkQ7UcMCmBpDDM:&imgrefurl=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2012/9/gangnam-style-now-most-liked-video-in-youtube-history-44977/&docid=ip3U-a6c4hoT4M&imgurl=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/media/5964189/Gangnam-Article-580-327.jpg&w=580&h=327&ei=m298UPds57fLAeuggZAH&zoom=1&iact=hc&vpx=637&vpy=311&dur=33&hovh=168&hovw=299&tx=168&ty=96&sig=103907305742552275770&page=1&tbnh=140&tbnw=249&start=0&ndsp=50&ved=1t:429,r:10,s:0,i:101" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">link to www.google.com</a>]</div></div><div class="postWrap"><div class="postHead"><div class="postAuthor">Rothschild</div><div class="postDetails">User ID: 5806149 United States 10/15/2012 04:22 PM</div></div><div class="postMain"><div class="quoteo"><div class="quotei">Hi OP, thank you for being You.<br></div><span class="c2">Quoting: <strong>Anonymous Coward 25301720</strong><a class="sm1 sm_text c1" href="/forum1/message1685421/reply33885675" rel="nofollow" title="Go to Quoted Post"></a></span></div><br><br> Hello Mr. German and Welcome!<br><br> I like Germans, generally.<br><br> Serious humans with the skill sets to back up the talk.<br><br> Carry on!</div></div><div class="postWrap"><div class="postHead"><div class="postAuthor">Rothschild</div><div class="postDetails">User ID: 5806149 United States 10/15/2012 04:30 PM</div></div><div class="postMain"><div class="c3"></div><div class="quoteo"><div class="quotei">Hello,<br><br> Let's step this up a notch shall we...<br><br> Nothing can exist without a relationship, so unless there is a bridge to this future pRof talk about then none of us will perceive it.<br><br> Let me introduce a poem, "Bickle Bickle always fickle, how your head has grown.

Hope your still posting.<br><br> About 12 years ago I watched a documentry about money and secret societies and it really shook me, all my belief systems came crashing down and since then I've been obsessively looking for the truth of what is.<br><br> For a long time I had a lot of hate and anger toward the cabal/illuminati but for some reason I started to let that go, instead of looking for answers outside of me i started to look inward, things seemed to happen synchronistically. Instead of thinking from the mind i was feeling from the heart and using my intuition more. I changed my diet drastically, started to meditate and learned to control my ego self. I became very much at peace with my self. I was eating the right foods, thinking positively, having compassion,gratitude etc I felt my vibrational energy was really high.<br><br> I got to the point where i felt I was one with all things, pure unconditional love for all, total bliss. It got to the point where I felt i was god :) that everything that was manifesting around me I had a huge part in its happening. Soon after though, fear took a real hold of me, i guess I wasn't ready for what I was experiencing. I went from the highest high to the lowest low. As much as i tried to hold myself together the fear/anxiety had a huge grip on me. I was suicidal. Eventually after a year or 2 I've gotten myself back to my normal self so to speak but still suffering some anxiety.<br><br> Anyway my question is was this whole episode brought on by psychosis and some cannabis use? Was what i experienced "real" in a way? or was it just my mind playing games with me:) Im also interested in the fear i experienced, i was told by a healer I had an energy blockage but might this fear be caused by an outside source?<br><br> Are we all a spark of a divine? Is there a divine being/energy?<br><br> If your still hear OP I'd like to ask some questions if thats ok but I've rambled on enough for now :)<br><br> regards.<br></div><span class="c2">Quoting: <strong>Anonymous Coward 25494678</strong><a class="sm1 sm_text c1" href="/forum1/message1685421/reply33876506" rel="nofollow" title="Go to Quoted Post"></a></span></div><br><br><br> Hello Mr. Ireland and Welcome!<br><br> I will say that I find your country and people to be a pleasure...although your ilk could take some cooking lessons from the French.<br><br> Laughing out Loud!<br><br> I cannot say from the information provided the nature of your revelation!<br><br> HOWEVER, it is the natural state of humans to exist in a permanent state of BLISS...a state of which your description would represent a BAD DAY.<br><br> Laughing out Loud!<br><br> You are designed, and have all the tools at your immediate disposal, to live such a life!

Why, you might ask? Because that is the typical period of cellular regeneration and re-coding which takes place on a regular basis in the human body. The body is truly capable of immortality were one to adopt and adapt correct practices in daily routines.<br><br> This capability for immortality is unique among the various species, both domestic and inter-galactic.which is why the human species has been approached so gingerly.<br><br> During your transformative experience, you will doubtlessly encounter resistance from family, friends and acquaintances who fear to tread the path of the ancients. Resist the temptation to pontificate, and do not rejoice in their eventual decomposition. You will be the vanguard of a new age!<br><br> Take a look at these 70 year old VEGANS! Imagine telling these two that they need to follow the FOOD PYRAMID of cheap carbs, slaughtered innocents and bulk corn syrup, sugars, GMO's and chemical additives.
